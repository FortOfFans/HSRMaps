Its brilliance was so blinding that even Oronyx's night veil recoiled before it. Under its protection, multiple city-states rose from barren lands, transforming even the most desolate regions into thriving havens. But that was before the Dance of the Scorching Sun was extinguished. Now, those once-prosperous cities stand as lifeless ruins, echoes of a bygone era.",
