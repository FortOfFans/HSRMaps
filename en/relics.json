His flesh twitched and throbbed beneath his skin, like river carps flipping and swarming... Fascinating powers ceaselessly reconstructed his body, bringing an everlasting pain of bones and tendons rupturing and healing. As countless phantom agonies and torments tore through his body, his shattered past was also beginning to come together...

His eyepiece reflected the essence of this Dreamscape — People spend like wastrels in the Moment of Dusk only to \"seek the impossible in dreams.\" From then on, Penacony's dreams started to contain many incredulous objects: Teapots that can tell jokes, race cars that twirl as they drive, and mansions that switch their location every day... Most of them are utterly useless, however they are being sold at astronomical prices. And those who visit from afar are willing to toss mountains of cash for them.\\n\\nThis is a fantastical Dreamscape, so why not indulge in madness? The words \"Exclusive and only in the dream\" are enough to redefine the worth of luxuries in the Dreamscape.\\n\\nThe Alfalfa Family and old Dreamchasers from the commercial world often feel regret about this, lamenting that they did not spot these opportunities at earlier times. The Watchmaker simply saw a bit further than them — Just a bit further every time."

Countless in quantity, they were difficult to store, and she couldn't be bothered to manage them herself.\\n\\nThe generous and charitable Interastral Peace Corporation then proposed a solution and that was how the Herta Space Station, where wisdom and secrets are stored, was born. Comprehensive containment measures were made throughout the space station, all in the pursuit of organizing everything in the collection with order and clarity. Phenomena were stored in specialized containers while Curios were regulated in indices. Innumerable items were categorized and classified, then stored deep within the station for research.\\n\\nThe IPC then proposed a collaboration in exploring the secrets of the stars together, which brought curious and adventurous scholars into the station to conduct research.\\n\\nMost of them admired Madam Herta, vowing to never abandon their ethereal aspirations and explore the secrets whispered among the stars. They investigated the star systems and realms of living beings, debated true justice in discourses on ethics and philosophies, outlined valleys and peaks within galaxies, deciphered secrets behind religious rituals and ceremonies, held on to the way of seeking truth from practice... They were the true believers of passing knowledge to posterity, and practiced unrestrained and divergent research.\\n\\nHowever, once the space station moved into orbit, it started to operate on its own and Madam Herta rarely showed herself. It was then that the IPC realized the whole station was filled with the mundane daily activities of the researchers, yet the genius was nowhere to be seen.\\n\\nLight from different zones rendered people unaware of the passage of time, the traces of which could only be detected in the burnt out lifestyle in the station. Often a smattering of researchers would argue non-stop about a particular piece of collection, even going so far as to start a fight. Occasionally a security officer would be absent from their daily patrol and nap instead on their military-styled bunker. Sometimes senior researchers would share with their younger peers tales of past romances, while some big shots would disguise themselves as temporary workers to bid their time for the next big turn of luck... Besides research, there was also life. They just had to look outside the hull — for the stars were journeying with them.\\n\\nDespite all the limitations, the researchers still talked about the everyday life in the space station in their own romantic way — The cosmos was a profound epic poem, and Herta Space Station was slowly cracking open the poetry collection."

			"The space station endured and survived many a crisis due to being owned by Madam Herta.\\n\\nLaden with the rarest items in the entire universe like a feast set before ravenous guests, the space station was never free from threats or unwanted attention. Relying on the security personnel hired by the IPC and a somewhat advanced defensive system proved insufficient to handle the hostility from the stars... Madam Herta once made prescient judgment and steered the station away in an elegant curve, ending a conspiratorial attempt to assault the station before it even initiated.\\n\\nAs for her mastery in gathering intel to solve crises, she simply described it as \"I spend time brewing coffee while others are reading books.\"\\n\\nRather than thieves who intend to steal its collection or mysterious factions with unknown objectives, the main threat faced by the space station remains its owner. The station could immediately fall into disaster if she ever had a wild idea. Curios that simulate a stellar collapse, a distorted gravitational field caused by the collision of dark galaxies... Madam Herta collected them all when she was in the mood, but would often lose interest once she got her hands on them.\\n\\nHence, though the space station appears to be floating peacefully in space, its treasure hoard of multi-shaped crises hung above it like a sword waiting to fall.\\n\\nSenior researchers had long been aware of the dangers they faced, and understood that \"secrets lie deep within danger.\" They strictly adhere to confidentiality agreements and faithfully carry out regulated containment procedures, thus burying danger within an outward silence... In the cafeteria, they were friends who could joke around. Yet, deep in the bowels of the space station's storage zones, they were highly skilled experts. In this place, secrets would always remain secrets.\\n\\nThe space station is operating as usual in low orbit around The Blue. Just like a pebble pushed out onto the smooth surface of a frozen lake, the station will continue to glide evenly and steadily in complete silence."

			"Thousands of years ago, the Xianzhou Luofu set sail from an ancient nation, crossing deep space to seek an audience with a god in pursuit of the elixir of immortality.\\n\\nThe colossal ship enclosing entire biospheres lumbered into the starry sky like a lucid moon silently falling into the night, embarking on an endless and aimless journey. In this lonely voyage, people slumbered, woke up, and slumbered again in incessant alternation... Star-chasing whales fell from the dome of heaven, and crystalline entities made of subgrain lattice managed to span light years without a single crack. The Elixir Seekers witnessed the majesty of various supernatural powers. In covert delight, they further hardened their resolve to obtain immortality.\\n\\nAfter voyaging for thousands of years, the Xianzhou Luofu gradually came to a halt, whereupon it encountered the master of Abundance in the limbo between the reality and the imaginary. Yaoshi bestowed a divine miracle upon the ship, and it immediately manifested as the Ambrosial Arbor. Its shade was as large as clouds, blocking out the sky and sun. Its roots were thick and dense, enveloping the entire Xianzhou ship — the Luofu seemed to be brought to life.\\n\\nThose who coveted immortality swallowed the fruit of the Ambrosial Arbor, and finally obtained the Endless Lifespan they had dreamed so much about. The Xianzhou residents began to claim they were celestial beings worthy of endless lifespans in abundance, and they also learned to use the Ambrosial Arbor to create various inhuman marvels via the blessings of immortality.\\n\\nYet, just like the shifting of the sun and moon, what once prospered was fated to decline and what once brought elation must eventually induce agony. It was not until the arrival of the Three Sufferings, when people were tormented to near extinction, that the Xianzhou people finally came to understand the true nature of this so-called miracle, which was nothing but harrowing calamity.\\n\\nIn the midst of disaster, a hero rose with the Reignbow and split the Ambrosial Arbor in half. The Xianzhou people regained their dignity as humans, and vowed to return to mortality and purge all deathless doom in this universe. In the ensuing years, Xianzhou went on a hunt across the stellar seas, taking it upon themselves to purge all deathless abominations. The foxians regained their freedom and took back control of the sky, while the Vidyadhara sealed off the contamination and any residual catastrophes. The three races were then brought together in a covenant and coalition. Thus was born the Xianzhou Alliance.\\n\\nProsperity and calamity came and went in cycles during the voyage. Heroes and legends rose to fame and glory one after another as history marched on. Now, the Xianzhou Luofu is healing and reconstructing in a period of hard-won peace. Free trade and open minds truly brought it back to life.\\n\\nImmortality had permanently molded the Xianzhou Luofu. With its ups and downs through history, the Xianzhou Luofu accumulated its own unique aura that combined both antiquity and modernity. It would only take any traveling merchant mere seconds to feel the marks left by the passage of time on this ark."

From that moment, the ancient taboos and laws were rendered useless, and nature's dictum and ethics regarding aging and death became irrelevant history.

Rebellions of the aurumatons and external invasions marked a ruinous millennium, after which the darkness hidden in immortal bloodlines also showed its face.

The Abominations of Abundance launched multitudes of assaults, where flesh was distorted and blood was spilled, for the sole purpose of devouring Xianzhou whole. The Arbor also tempted the Xianzhou residents. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus broke the taboos and ventured deep into the secret of Abundance within the Ambrosial Arbor, hoping to reforge the once mighty immortal empire... In the long days of foreign and domestic troubles, the remaining corpus of the Ambrosial Arbor lurked like unending vines propagating in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to wreak havoc again.\\n\\nFortunately, the Xianzhou Luofu never lowered its guard against the withered tree.

The puny humans had no intention of imitating the feats of the god, instead gathering into a self-proclaimed \"support team\" for the Aeon, willing to devote everything to the Amber Lord.

According to the scholars' hypothesis, this action is tantamount to cell division in carbon-based life. Thereafter, currents randomly output different potentials via the transistor structure naturally formed on the planetary surface, creating the most primitive program. The proud scholars argued that in this way, machines have \"thoughts\" that are comparable to carbon-based life.\\n\\nA mechanic objected to this: How can carbon-based life, which has not even been able to understand the origin of their own beings, have the gall to spout such fallacies?

The giant screen-like perforated belt was tireless, and the rectangular array filtered the late-night moonlight. Screwllum couldn't stop thinking. <i>Do ends to recursions really exist?</i> He thought. <i>What is the nature of inorganic life — or yet, what is the origin of the universe?</i>\\n\\n<i>Am I really willing to be only a witness to the ideas of my predecessors?</i>\\n\\n\"No,\" Screwllum concluded.

			"If viewed from a cosmic perspective, Planet Salsotto as a whole, due to its vast seas of sand, shined in the most dazzling shade of gold, with its giant meteorite craters clearly visible.\\n\\nAt a certain fateful moment, waves upon waves of strange meteorites ceaselessly fell onto Planet Salsotto. The long-lasting impact caused by the Meteoric Starfall relentlessly hitting the planet at such a particular angle caused the planet's rotation to gradually come to a halt. It was like pushing a world-deactivate button. Salsotto's days and nights became longer and longer, until every sunrise and sunset would last for a seeming eternity, until nobody could take it any longer, until the whole planet's rotation was finally brought to a standstill...\\n\\nIt had become a fact of life that sizzling summers under the scorching sun and dark nights of bitter coldness would last for half a year. What was left of the whole Salsotto were the last two remaining cities that were moving non-stop, always running right after the terminator line.\\n\\nThe colossal fortress was floating in the air like a gargantuan raincloud, slowly hovering across the sky above the golden desert with thundering noise. Wherever it went, overwhelming storms of sand were cascading down and over. In the giant moving city, the Salsottians in winged suits were flying up and down among the city's buildings. These flying folks who had survived the calamity by sheer luck now belonged to the sky and were bound to it at the same time.\\n\\nIn the morning, skyfishers departed from the port and dove right for the sand, where they would hunt the phlogiston jellyfish. They would only return to the city after dusk. By the power of mysterious creatures, the city barely managed to voyage ahead.\\n\\nEven though their entire survival relied squarely on those two fragile wings, the Salsottians were optimistic by nature and would never let the heavy burden of fate lower their spirit or bend their spine. They would find time to spend with their family playing glass musical instruments, with such an attitude that it was almost as if they could carve the musical notes right into the glass. They also enjoyed making pen pals and would often place their written messages in the Dandelion Letterbox, meant for the moving city on the other end of the terminator line.\\n\\nGradually, the planet's magnetic field weakened and the atmosphere thinned. In the face of a fated doom, the sparkles of life were not yet snuffed out, and the eagles would never cease to fly."

The line of dawn and dusk swept across the earth, climbed over mountains and ravines, brought dawn to those still awake, and sent sunset to those who would soon sleep... But when the rhythm of light and darkness slowed down, day and night were no longer familiar, and the seemingly eternal heat and coldness were like the quagmire of hell, slowly burying all lives entrapped within. This was why the Salsottian people, barely surviving at the time, boarded the floating mobile city and began their chase with dawn and dusk.\\n\\nClimbing atop the observation deck of the mobile city of Tumbleweed and looking in the direction that they were moving, daylight lies ahead and dark night behind.\\n\\nThe pursuit of \"Tumbleweed\" is not only for survival but also for a dignified life. When it moved faster than the terminator line, then the early morning light would march into the afternoon; when slower than the terminator line, then the dusk light would fade into the late night. In this way, the naturally optimistic Salsottian managed to restore every day to its original state. The romance in their bloodline blessed them with the easygoing spirit to sing leisurely in peaceful afternoons and sleep soundly on starry nights.\\n\\nHowever, this voyage of tenacity and perseverance would, at last, come to its final downfall, and the ruins of the once mobile city were eventually left far behind by the ever-shifting terminator line.\\n\\nYears later, the two moving cities that had never met each other would finally stand against each other, with their respective turrets among the wreckage still aimed in opposition. One of the two cities must have crossed half of the planet to the other one and started the initial incursion. Traces of brutal warfare between the two cities were still occasionally discernible under the sand dunes, which merged with unnameable hatred and morphed together into the same ruins.\\n\\nPlanet Salsotto kept its silence. And ever since a certain unknown time, the duration of each of its rotation cycles had somehow gradually decreased, ushering in its own self-healing in an unpopulated future."

The planet-destroying wars of the past brought mountains upon mountains of ruins and wreckage onto the surface of Talia, resulting in imperishable radiation and taking away the last remaining hope to sustain life. The thieves had nowhere else to go and fell into a cave beneath the surface of the planet, which turned out to be a tunnel left by the rodent race... The thieves managed a narrow escape, and their dream of establishing a Kingdom of Banditry was thus discreetly born in this lost realm of seclusion.\\n\\nInnumerable caverns were interconnected in a massive labyrinth. More groups of thieves and bandits were lured in by this supposed dreamland meant for them and came to accumulate wealth and exchange technology, subsequently laying the foundation for the kingdom.\\n\\nAs more and more thieves and bandits settled down here, the once desolate planet became extraordinarily bustling with life. Thieves of great renown spoke of their ideal of a Kingdom of Banditry, promising to use the treasury to build a nation of equity and fairness. But as the amount of accumulated wealth grew larger and larger, the same thieves tore up their flimsy promises right away and attempted to monopolize all the wealth. Mercenaries, riots, double crossings, and betrayals... Chaos ensued one after another. Perhaps the initiators never even once believed in their ideal of so-called equity for all.\\n\\nHenceforth, thieves who resented lofty ideals found themselves in a chaotic age where ignorance was glorified. They seized water sources to build towns of their own and mocked the very idea of fairness and justice.\\n\\nEveryone in Nailscrap Town was a bandit. They drove violently destructive off-road vehicles and fought for resources with other hordes of bandits in the desert. They created mechanical armor and weapons out of scrap iron and old wires... The more barren the wasteland was, the more freedom they got out of it, like one final frenzy before doomsday. Those sweet dreams were like wisps of nonsense in the radiating heat waves and had long ceased to leave any trace behind.\\n\\nIn a half-awake trance, the thieves came to the realization that the Kingdom of Banditry was never about creation but about destruction."

On the thieves' starship, shields made of steel plates were removed layer by layer, and the power lines were crudely stripped apart, all of which were then used to build the first-ever alliance market. The thieves there began to accumulate wealth and at the same time started to talk about their ideals. Soon after, the protracted infighting began, where suspicion and betrayal were expressed by and against one another. The flames of the war fought between the dictator and their detractors eventually spread from the underground tunnel to the surface-level desert grounds...\\n\\nThis exposed wire was even older. It was dug out of a pothole by the bandits and then connected to a revamped overland vehicle with air leaking in from all directions, which was driven to a distant water source.\\n\\nThe top priority for all survivors of the war of betrayal was to locate Talia's water sources. They drove thousands of miles a day on deserts littered with glass shards in extremely shabby and poorly made vehicles. The caravans of the bandits sometimes chased each other, raising dust and heavy smoke, and other times they just wantonly threw people on or off the car... The sheer pressure of survival forced them to give up all other thoughts. Only by forging ahead could they be saved from confusion.\\n\\nThis naked wire was always old. It was further removed from the overland vehicle and placed into the town's lightbox by the bandits.

Eccentric engineers accidentally made machinery out of waste, and desperate wastelanders also enjoyed fighting back and forth in the underground arena... Late at night in a bar, they filled their glasses with grape juice that smelled like gasoline and cheered together, celebrating the fact that they had managed yet another day of survival.\\n\\nThere was nothing new in Talia, just old things repurposed differently in changing times."

The lack of sunlight in the undergrowth of the rainforest throughout the year creates a perfect space for fungi and other low-light plants to grow. Intelligent creatures inhabited regions near the tropics. Plants, irrespective of height, would grow naturally here. Fresh fruits and vegetables could be picked at any time and anywhere, which was what the locals mostly fed on.\\n\\nHowever, be it the new immigrants or the indigenous Wacqwacq beings, they have always maintained a quasi-religious reverence for the animal fruits growing on the Thestang tree.\\n\\nThe great Thestang tree never stopped bearing fruit, not even for a moment. With time, all those yellowish and translucent oval-shaped fruits grew larger and heavier, hanging down from the branches until the stems could no longer bear their weight. When the time came, fruits would fall to the ground with a loud and crisp sound, cracking their thin skin and releasing whatever was held within. The fauna of Vonwacq was all born this way, be it fish, birds, or polar bears. On Planet Vonwacq, creatures of all kinds shared one common birth mother.\\n\\nThe fiend known as the \"Demon King\" was also born from one such fruit of the Thestang tree. From the moment of its birth, it instinctively knew how to swing its giant ax-like pincers toward others, waging war upon the entire biosphere of Vonwacq.\\n\\nEvery sixty natural years, the Thestang tree would give birth to a new demon king, and the cycle went on and on. The people of Vonwacq had long been used to and prepared for such cyclical fates of doom. Whenever a demon king's awakening approached, they would temporarily set aside their disputes and work together, assembling their strongest warriors to set sail for Wacq Island... One sixty years after another sixty years, these seemingly pointless crusades had been launched over and over again for hundreds of years in such narrow landscapes on this small planet. The demon kings were the permanent disaster of Vonwacq, and the caches of civilization were periodically wiped out.\\n\\nThus, it could be said that Planet Vonwacq was more like a stagnating pool of dead water, even though it was teeming with lively creatures that were ceaselessly fighting with each other, seemingly full of possibilities for change."

Soon after, the outsiders boarded the locals' boats and sailed to Wacq Island, curious about how a demon king would be born from the fruit. The tribal warriors lay low on the shoals in trepidation, closely clenching their Stone Age weapons. To fight for sixty years of peace, they seemed determined, ready to make the ultimate sacrifice, one where they may never return home.\\n\\nAs the war went on, the outsiders discovered the truth about the \"Demon King\" — It was a species of interstellar worm that had once been considered extinct.

They pushed aside the drooping branches of the giant tree and sank into the quagmire, almost half-submerged. In the sunken lands of the rainforest, the outsiders found a control cabin. It was then that the secret of Vonwacq was finally revealed — the Thestang tree turned out to be the eco genesis system from a much higher civilization, which could decode and then release innumerable life forms to restore the planet's biosphere.\\n\\nThe demon king that cyclically rampaged the planet turned out to be just one single piece of data in the vast biologic database. The outsiders deleted the data of the demon king and then left Vonwacq, not seeking any credit or gratitude from the locals.\\n\\nThe sound of tidal waves battering against the seaside land was the only audible sound on the coastline of Wacq Island. The indigenous coalition forces of Vonwacq were all lined up and were convinced that the demon king would never come again. Then they cheered, toasted, sang, and talked all night about a future without demon kings. However, almost immediately after the two allied tribes bid farewell and returned to their respective homelands, the two tribes began plotting wars for their takeover of the whole of Vonwacq... Without a common threat such as the demon king, their alliance was but a non-binding piece of paper. The small planet was never designed to withstand a conflict between the two tribes. And the short-lived, fragile peace had since shattered out of existence.\\n\\nThe coastline of Wacq Island remained in its enigmatic calm as if nothing had ever transpired on these shores.

And from whence did \"they\" come?\\n\\nIn the days of old, the people of Insumousu knew not the art of metallurgy, nor had they yet invented written language. Thus, they turned to imagination to supplement their knowledge, and sought to understand all through the telling of stories. \"Legends\" were born as stories passed through the generations, turning into \"myths\" over time. \"Myths\" then shaped cognition as they themselves endure the flow of time — until \"civilization\" was born. As centuries passed and stars shifted in the sky, Thalassa became a trade partner of the Xianzhou Alliance. It was then that the aquatic people of Insumousu set foot inside the \"celestial palace\" for the first time. There, they beheld the complete grandeur of the Xianzhou, and at last learned the truth behind the Divine Fall.\\n\\nThe well-educated Insumousu gentry always regarded themselves as a continuation of the Daiyu. \"What the Daiyu once followed, we should follow. What the Daiyu once fought against, we should also fight.\" When they tell stories from the past, they would still begin with these words:\\n\\n\"Once upon a time, the palace of the gods fell from the heavens.\""

Insumousu's poets thus sing: \"The ocean may swallow mortals, yet their spirits live on forevermore.\"\\n\\nIn accordance with the calendar of Insumousu, the second day of rest in the Month of Tides is Divine Fall Day — when the water dwellers recite scriptures, consume herbs, and perform bizarre dances along the current in honor of the fallen \"gods\" who brought a blessing to Insumousu. In modern times, Divine Fall Day gradually lost its original religious meaning — songs replace scriptures, delicacies replace herbs, and only the peculiar dances remain to this day as a cultural heritage.\\n\\nIn the past few hundred Star Calendar years, Insumousu has been generous in sharing its unique culture with the outside world, and the form of Divine Fall Day has quietly undergone more changes.\\n\\nInsumousu's land cities are usually full of young people, prone to staying up all night singing and dancing during Divine Fall Day. Foreign visitors, especially Xianzhou tourists, often choose to join in the festivities. Foreigners frequently fall in love with the vibrant atmosphere of the cities, these places filled with fiery passion as unstoppable as tsunamis. As the water dwellers grow out of their adolescent years, their lungs would gradually shrink, their necks metamorphose into gills, and their hands, feet, and eyes become more suited for underwater life. The poets always say, \"The people of Insumousu give their noisy and boisterous youth to the land, and their quiet and solemn old age to the ocean.\"\\n\\nWith the support of Xianzhou's Celestial Guild, a new ritual was added to the Divine Fall Day celebration — People would dive into the wreckage of the Xianzhou Daiyu to search for the remains of Xianzhou humans, then inter them into starskiffs and launch the skiffs into the star of the Thalassa system.\\n\\nThrough their discovery of the history of the Daiyu, the people of Insumousu also learned of the tragedy behind its fall. When the Xianzhou Daiyu was irreparably damaged and breaking apart, Qingzhu, leader of the Daiyu, made the courageous decision to sacrifice herself and the entire ship to end the curse of the immortality plague. The Xianzhou Alliance hopes that the fallen heroes will receive a dignified soul-soothing ceremony and the people of Insumousu, who were spared from the disaster, have given their response.\\n\\nAt some point during the night of Divine Fall Day, the revelry would come to an abrupt halt. Adolescents, children, and Xianzhou residents would sit by the shore as adults emerge from the water and solemnly gaze at the oceanic horizon. Then, several starskiffs break through the water and fly from the bottom of the sea toward the star.\\n\\nThe starskiffs are each inscribed with a row of beautiful Insumousu calligraphy that reads, \"You should undo the ropes for drowned sailors. Don't cry. You can sail safely after my demise.\""

At the height of the empire's power, Her Majesty Empress Titania built a magnificent fleet, vowing to bring the fruits of civilization to all the barbaric borders, allowing them a taste of the empire's benevolence in hopes of uniting them under one rule.\\n\\nHowever, the expedition was eventually halted by endless waves of raging insectoids coming from beyond the sky. Glamoth's armies fought and failed, again and again... Colonies were scattered, and the proud iron fleet fell one after another. Besieged by the monsters with compound eyes and sheathed wings, the cries of the people of Glamoth were drowned out by despair, and the Welkin Empire was shattered from then on.\\n\\nUntil one day knights clad in mechanical armor descended from the sky and wiped out the sun-swallowing Swarm. Since then, the silver-white iron knights have traveled to and from the various star systems in the empire, crossing the devastated territories and fighting back against the calamity that wiped out the galaxy. They were like warriors born to fight the Swarm. No one knew the faces lying beneath the masks of the Iron Cavalry, but their arrival was like a gift from the gods, bringing the light of day back to the human world. Under the Empress' command, Glamoth's Iron Cavalry charged across the skies, finally stemming the tide of enemies and bringing a moment of respite to the empire.\\n\\nBut in the never-ending battle against their archenemy, the empire started becoming more and more like its adversary — more and more Iron Cavalry flew high into the sky, blotting out the heavens just as the Swarm did on that fateful day. The look people cast on the Empress and the cavalry turned to one of fear, a fear akin to what they felt toward the Swarm. Perhaps one day the empire would attain the victory it so desired. But on that day, will Glamoth still be a paradise for humanity to rest in?\\n\\nThe Iron Cavalry Regiment formed the last line of defense at the border of Glamoth, where the battle raged on endlessly. Upon their warships, the silent knights bore a mission, carrying the hopes of the entire empire, and faced the tides of enemies drowning out the stars."

Guests from other lands defy gravity and walk on walls. Strange toys come to life and roam the streets in celebration. The water from the spring turn into a giant whale and swim through the halls. Opening a window no longer show a view of the stars in the deep sky, but of the city's shifting streams of light and shadows, holding up the constant echoes of giant clocks and theaters. The guests finally realize that they were never awake, but are instead witnessing Penacony's true nature in a dream — a place where time stops in a neverending dreamscape.\\n\\nEveryone knows that, under the rule of \"The Family,\" the doors of Penacony are open to everyone amidst the stars. For a transcendent experience, for an inspirational excitement, for the soothing of worries and wounds — guests of the highest caliber come to surrender their pain in exchange for peace and tranquility, to drink the best of the best, and to wander in the sea of dreams. Some spend unforgettable holidays here and leave content, while others become obsessed with the festivities and settle down here. The star-studded hotel is the jewel of dream weavers, the kingdom of dream makers, and the playground of dream seekers.\\n\\nFew guests are aware of the dusty history of the past — the thread that weaves the dreams comes from reality. The velvety splendor of today's Penacony was born of salty rust, heavy shackles, and deprived freedom. The Planet of Festivities was once an IPC prison, where countless inmates were relocated to salvage the overflowing Memory Bubbles for the Garden of Recollection. People repeated their endless toils until their bodies were as heavy as lead, but their souls became as light as bubbles. At some unknown point in time, the small cells cut off access to reality, but people's consciousnesses became linked in dreams. In the midnight bell, that shared dream seemed so real, reflecting the sheer hypocrisy of reality.\\n\\nIt lasted until the Destruction melted the chains of the IPC, the Trailblaze connected this frontier to the other stars, and the Harmony arrived upon invitation to sow the seeds of peace. Freedom finally broke ground and added a new name to the original dream — Penacony.\\n\\nToday, there is no trace of the crumbling prison. In the dream world, a myriad of skyscrapers has been erected and the desert has been rebuilt and transformed into a metropolis — a new world for dreamers in search of wealth and opportunities, and a utopia for those in search of indulgence and pleasure. The past of the Planet of Festivities is like a photo that fell to the bottom of a cupboard — it exists, but is seen by no one.\\n\\nNowadays, the land of dreams is filled with songs of joy, and the noise of the past have been relegated to gossip, silently lost in the interlude of a comedy, in the behind-the-scenes of some cartoon, or in the side column of some magazine."

The opulent hotel is just the tip of the iceberg of the Planet of Festivities, and it is only when you \"stay and dream\" that you are considered to have officially arrived at Penacony. From then on, the land of dreams, consisting of twelve dreamscapes, slowly expands before the guests' eyes.\\n\\nGuests who are new to the place may be overwhelmed by this carnival stage, but do not be alarmed. Look up and see the metal tracks crisscrossing the skyscrapers and the Spheroids rapidly rolling along them. They are the most visible means of transportation in this dreamscape metropolis and guide guests to each and every place around the city.\\n\\nStarting from the central station, the complicated Spheroid tracks are like the blood vessels of the metropolis. Whether it is the underground tunnels of the Moment of Daybreak, the vast fields of the Moment of Scorchsand, or the glittering stadium of the Moment of Stars, the colorful Spheroids roll on and on, delivering people to each station accurately, efficiently, safely, and comfortably, pouring a sleepless energy into the dream world of Penacony.\\n\\nDreams give a light and delicate texture to everything, and the nut-like Spheroids are regarded as both vehicles and as toys in the land of dreams. However, few remember that the Spheroids are actually imprisonment cages — the vehicle towards dreams are tools originally used for locking up prisoners.\\n\\nA long time ago, the IPC sent a huge number of prisoners to the Asdana star system in an attempt to stop a catastrophe from spreading. There, people reclaimed memoria, gradually becoming lost between fantasy and reality. The spherical work chambers in vacuum became an unforgettable \"memory\" for the prisoners — the hard curved interior walls, the awful experience of tumbling around, the unbearable daily attendance — perhaps these pains ran too deep. When those who regained their freedom pioneered the barren dreamscape, the spherical cages came along with them.\\n\\nBut now, unlike in the past, peace and freedom have given birth to optimism. Instead of trying to destroy the inescapable nightmares over and over, it is better to add to them the color this place should have, to take them in, and embrace them. So, the spherical imprisonment cages of the past have become today's Spheroids.\\n\\nIn the present, the fast-moving colorful Spheroids moving all over Penacony and the slight reverberations coming from within them... are all quietly hidden in the light of the dream city, blending in with the ambitions and laughter, like a land of dreams where time forever stands still."

One of these challenges is the desolate planet known as Sigonia-IV, which is covered in barren deserts and scarred by clan vendettas... a place of harsh conditions and strife.\\n\\nSituated near the convergence of three major star clusters, Sigonia-IV has long been subjected to stellar winds from multiple stars, earning its reputation as the \"eye of the storm\" throughout the Cosmos. The planet's surface environment is extremely harsh, leading many civilizations to either migrate to other celestial bodies or succumb to natural disasters. Now, only a small number of intelligent races remain there, referred to as Sigonians by scholars from the Intelligentsia Guild.\\n\\nIn reality, Sigonians have fragmented into numerous clans, with most adopting nomadic lifestyles, while a few have established centralized systems of governance of reasonable size.\\n\\nThey share a common language. Through the translation provided by the Synesthesia Beacon, you will learn that \"Katica\" means \"shellslasher,\" who have a reputation of being the most ferocious clan among Sigonians. And \"Avgin\" means \"honey,\" who are often accused of pilfering by those willfully ignorant. These clans share a vendetta that lasted through Amber Eras, engaged in a cycle of bloody vengeance in the boundless wilderness where only the fittest survive — until mysterious figures clad in black descended from the sky. From there, Sigonians were briefly united under the radiance of Amber, and the natural cycles that were finally reached a temporary conclusion.\\n\\nAfterward, under the IPC's guidance, the Sigonians established the Sigonian Sovereignty according to the Interstellar Peace Charter and took their first steps toward the wider Cosmos.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this unity and progress did not extend to the Avgins and Katicans. Some malicious opportunists among the Sigonians viewed the former's resourcefulness with suspicion, while slandering the latter as nothing more than predators with no hope of enlightenment. Although they possessed only limited knowledge about Preservation, they understood that some of them had to be sacrificed for it. Utilizing a highly advanced set of parliamentary rules, these devious and corrupt individuals banished both clans to the endless desert.\\n\\nAs a token of apology, they even went out of their way to declare that \"the Avgins shall forever retain the right to autonomy\" — In other words, should any future conflicts occur between the two clans, they could justifiably and lawfully sit back and do nothing."

It was a stormy night when the clouds and fog engulfed the northern lights, which should have been seen as an ill omen. However, the Avgin people were unexpectedly excited. When questioned about this, a maiden from the clan provided the following response.\\n\\n\"Rain is a gift from the Mother Goddess. SHE is calling to us, urging us to take up arms and fight for our future.\"\\n\"This rain accompanies us. This rain protects us. It is in this rain that we shall meet our honorable demise.\""

It could turn the sky into walls and fortresses and pose obstacles for the Magatsu no Morokami's steps.</i>\\n<i>The third was \"Howl,\" forged with the slain Almighty Thunder. It could summon lightning to tear the sky, and the soaring meteors and thunder to serve divine justice.</i>\\n<i>The fourth was \"Mist,\" forged with the slain Everbreath. It could make winds break and shear the land, for gales to rage forever unceasing.</i>\\n<i>The fifth was \"Frost,\" forged with the slain Heaven's Winter Cloak. It could freeze and still the very order of time, to create boundless frozen wastes and stretch one moment into eternity.</i>\\n<i>The sixth was \"Fate,\" forged with the slain Spurned Sister of Mortality. It could make flowers bloom and cover barren graves, for life and death to dance in a cycle and dissipate.</i>\\n<i>The seventh was \"Flare,\" forged with the slain Flamebringer. It could summon fires to burn down the very world, to torch the skies and to char the earth.</i>\\n<i>The eighth was \"Thought,\" forged with the slain Wisdom Supreme. It could discern the past and future with the water mirror, to tell truth from lies over years beyond reckoning.</i>\\n<i>The ninth was \"Root,\" forged with the slain Father of Lands. It could command islands to float into the heavens, for mountains and valleys to burst before armies.</i>\\n<i>The tenth was \"Form,\" forged with the slain Nether Lord. It could make the masses join in unity, for endless forms to ebb and flow as one.</i>\\n<i>The eleventh was \"Bind,\" forged with the slain Omen Ward. It drove misfortune into a binding cage, for evil and demons to instantly vanish.</i>\\n<i>The twelfth was \"Maw,\" forged with the slain Woes Eighty. It could corrode and age the very mortal world and make equal Kami and Oni, leaving an entity's four souls to be sundered in twain.</i>\\n\\n<i>Then the underworld was cleared out, the wars called to a halt, and the twelve blades broken and locked.</i>\\n<i>In the emptiness the dead souls grew restless, and under the black sun two blades were forged as Bearers of the world's destiny.</i>\\n<i>One was named \"Origin\" and the other named \"End,\" for all begun with humanity and shall end with Oni-kind.</i>\\n<i>The sounds of lamentation ceased, and the dead flowers rose and fell. The losers returned to the void, and the winners... became null.</i>\\n\\nThe hobbling monk sang the song without a tune, for those who hold the power of Kami are walking backwards, towards divinity.\\nWitnessed by the great sun, the land once named Izumo became completely devoid... of humans, Oni, and Kami."

			"The beginning of ancient foxian and borisin ballads all nostalgically sing of the \"Planet of Verdant\" and the planet's fertile soil and pleasant climate. However, upon closer inspection, the perceptive ones will realize such words are mere preludes to the eternal theme of \"war.\"\\nWith their talents for agriculture and commerce, some fox clans built prosperous towns next to flowing rivers. Meanwhile, the children of wolves roamed with their herd under the aurora-covered sky within the lush grasslands, forming settlements that dotted the landscape. The merchants laughed at the herders for the latter's savagery, while the herders despised the merchants for their deception. However, they both must confront the cruel torments of nature — the \"Vulpesummer\" and \"Lupuswinter.\"\\nIn the summer of rich harvests blessed by the fox deity, the two clans put down their arms and ceased warfare in mutual satisfaction. But once the wolf deity lets fall the white frost, the snowlines would spread from the poles and hunger shall drive the two clans to unceasing conflict.\\nThe ballads mention that the Lupuswinter once stayed far beyond its due, even after the sun of the old verdant home had circled the planet thirty-three times. Poverty and hunger crashed the people, and they resorted to even eating animals they once worshipped as totems. After foreseeing the end where the entire world shall be covered in bleak death, a savior climbed to the peak of the tallest mountain in that world — The foxian legends called this lady Tushan, but the borisin sagas called this man Duran. No matter what this savior was called, they made a wish to the Master of Immortality, hoping for sustenance enough to keep the world's people alive. Then, the mountains split, and sweet divine nectar of Redspring poured out from the hilly ravines.\\nThose who drank from the Redspring obtained power, dexterity, and strength from the beast meat they devoured. Their blood, too, stirred with the ferocity of animals, and their bodily forms became increasingly bestial — Thus was this world changed, never to return to its former days.\\nWith the Redspring as the medium, everything that the reborn canine races needed was made from this miraculous source — The fields no longer grew grain but viscorpi instead, and the garments that covered people's bodies were no longer of linen but of embryonic flesh. Even the chilly snowlands that once terrified the old verdant home civilizations were no longer a concern, for the canine races cultivated biological membranes in the polar regions to craft into warm dome-shaped tents, blocking the impoverished Lupuswinter beyond this barrier.\\nThen, things changed in the Planet of Verdant, just like how things changed for every short-life species that became long-life — There was a population explosion, ecological collapse, internal warfare... And no matter how hard the canine races prayed to the Master of Immortality, they never heard another reply. Then, the people understood the truth: Everything that the Master of Immortality could give has been given, and if the people wish to have better lives, they must take it themselves.\\nGathered around Duran the great Brood Lord, the canine races cast their sight into the sky where the Master of Immortality dwelled. The stars sparkled like a grassland waiting to be conquered with fast steads, and they will bring the \"Lupuswinter\" to the civilizations on those planets.\\nMuch later, their sworn enemies gave them the name \"borisin,\" for \"boris\" meant \"wolf\" in the language of the Planet of Verdant."

			"In the borisin language, the bridle was also called assa-chita, meaning \"the living book.\"\\nWhen the duo rising moons met, and the night sky was at its brightest, the voodoo masters of the hunting tribe would gift bridles to the children of Duran to symbolize them entering adulthood. This pristine bridle would become a book that recorded the history of their battles throughout their lives.\\nAs soon as the adulthood ceremony ended, the borisin youths must walk into the weapon farm, then pick and tame their first battle mount among the \"mechabeasts\" that had been filtered and bred via gene witchcraft. Mechabeasts that consumed the conquered as their feed had astounding agility, perception, and ferocity — Yet they were considered mere sheep when faced against their future masters. As the moonlight stirred the violent blood in their veins, the borisin youths chased and dueled against the mechabeasts. Some would die from the beast's kiss — That would be the result of cowardice. Some would kill their peers — That was the law of how valiant beasts shall be distributed... The borisin youths tripped the desired mount to the ground and tied the bridle, inlaid with neural spike whips, onto the animal's neck — The beast would be stunned through telepathy with its future master and became as tame as they have received hundreds of whiplashes. When the beast willingly carried the master on its back, a fitting borisin sorya (warrior, rider) would have been born.\\nThen, the borisin bridle would become the recorder of wars, and the reins would gradually become full of scratches, knots, and accessories.\\nThe well-trained sorya would don jellyfish-like membranous armor under the leadership of a yonda (leader, centurion). They would then board the beast ships that can warp between stars, explore different worlds, and swear to make the stars into their herding ground in the name of Duran and the Master of Immortality. On the bridle, light scratches indicated how many enemies the owner had slain, knots recorded how many major campaigns they were involved in, and the accessories dangling from the reins were loot such as human teeth and Intellitron cores obtained from pillaging frenzies... They were the vengeance and wails of the conquered, as well as medals for borisin individuals to demonstrate their strength.\\nWhen the mounts beneath the warrior perished in warfare, or when borisin wished to mete out punishment, the bridle would also be fastened around the face of other living beings.\\nTheir targets were usually foxians — The slave race excluded from the clan due to genetic selection plans. They were weak, devious, and were only fit for lowly labor and calculations. Whenever rare war-like individuals emerged among the foxians, the master of the wolf-head would prioritize binding these foxians with the bridles, driving them as war slaves to serve as vanguards on the battlefield.\\nIf all slaves had died, and the weapons were bent, then the bridle could still act as a whip if one attached a spike to the end. If the bridle was snapped and the warrior perished in war with their fangs and claws shattered, then the bridle would become the sole remaining epitaph and memories for borisin...\\nJust as the old tales said that \"the position between the predator and prey often changes in the forest,\" countless wolf-kind bridles have broken and snapped after fighting for millennia against the Xianzhou in this dark forest called the universe. At the end, this link that connected various clans was severed by the sharp arrow of The Hunt, and borisin also fell into the shadow of internal strife and general decay, becoming ever more removed from their former pride."

			"The Xianzhou Zhuming had floated in the starry seas for over eight millennia after setting sail from the Primeval Imperium. If one were able to view a chronological snapshot of how the starship's form had changed, it would be a very romantic experience — The colossal ship swallowed a deep-blue star, peeled off the worn hull layer by layer, swelled as a brimming bud, and finally bloomed into a lotus.\\nFrom space, the entire Xianzhou Zhuming appears as a lotus lantern of filigree gold. The giant glowing \"lotus leaves\" gradually spread out around the \"light poles\" and are bathed in a soft blue glow, being indeed worthy of poems that declare it \"A ship whose hull deceives the eyes, a lotus whose petals like candles glow.\" The \"lampstand\" section at the center of the ship is a spherical cage, its size on the magnitude of a celestial object. It tightly wraps around the azure sun, the \"lantern wick,\" and eternally spins. This mega structure is the most important location for the Xianzhou Zhuming's manufacturing industry — the Flamewheel Forge.\\nIn the past, the Zhuming Grand Artisan Yang Di had received a weapon mold from the anonymous sovereign of the Primeval Imperium as a gift when the fleet set off on their voyage. Thousands of years later, though the fleet has now changed beyond recognition with their immortality and the return voyage will never occur, the tradition of the Grand Artisan never died. In the Xianzhou Zhuming, artisanship is the supreme school of learning. All its generals also held the title of the Artisanship Commission's Furnace Master. When they left the ship, they commanded thousands of troops. When they returned to the ship, they would swing their hammer and forge wondrous items, and receive the people's supreme respect. More than half of the weapons used in the Xianzhou's hunts throughout the fleet's history were forged in the Xianzhou Zhuming. Therefore, the Flamewheel Forge came to be regarded as the holy pilgrimage site for such technologies in the entire Cosmos.\\nMetalsmithing is a measure of the advance of civilizations, while flames mark the beginning of civilizations. Many civilizations, while in their infancy, were most troubled with the problem of energy sources. The people spared no effort in discovering energy sources that would support their civilization to new heights. The Xianzhou Zhuming had stepped over this limitation — By imprisoning the progenitor of heliobi, the Flint Emperor, the artisans have obtained a literally inexhaustible power source. The Flamewheel Forge has intricate branch-like track systems that cover the star as much as possible, and the delicate boughs and leaves are choked with receptors and transmitters that guide the primal fire \"Flint Emperor\" to provide enough energy for all technological developments.\\nCountless artisans had regarded the Zhuming Artisanship Commission, which swallowed up a Pseudo Sun, as the hallowed halls of the craft. Apprentices who wanted to forge divine tools swarm the institution. With enough force, anything can be crafted, and the Flamewheel Forge has prepared everything the artisans could possibly need —\\nApprentices from different worlds come together in the Forge and become fellow students, then compete and share their skills. Outworlders who come in search of marvelous tools would also pay a hefty sum to entrust artisans into crafting otherworldly items — However, the countless apprentices over the millennia have rarely been favored by General Huaiyan, the \"Artisan of Artisans.\" Whenever he tutored students himself and personally passed on his skills both as a craftsman and a soldier, these students would either become grandmasters who left a mark in the annals as Furnace Masters or became Cloud Knights with names that thundered through the Alliance such as the Flamewheel Octet.\\n\"Forges wrought a million stars bright, irons craft heroes' soaring flight. Miniscule lights into martial might made, only with sharp blades are peace and plenty kept.\" From the day a Zhuming artisan received their tools, they must always remember — What they will spend their days and nights making are no simple weapons, but the arrows carrying the creed of The Hunt."

			"The Xianzhou Zhuming has always been accompanied by multicolored light bands while voyaging in deep space. These bands are energy outputs from super-high-temperature fusion reactions, as well as evidence that the Flint Emperor still burns and shall never die.\\nOn the outermost skirts of the aurora-inducing particles that are dispersed with the Flint Emperor's breaths, newborn heliobi slow down and wander into being. The Flamehunt Judges of the Zhuming Ten-Lords Commission then capture naive heliobi that have not had any contact with emotions, using kind and gentle dreams to tame the immature temperaments of such flames. Then, the judges pass these harmless heliobi to the Artisanship Commission's Temperaflame Office, which matches the heliobi with various artifacts to make them into lamps, vehicles, and various spectacles in Zhuming... However, in the eyes of the confused outworlders, these talking and walking items are proof of the rumor that \"divine essence exists everywhere in the delves, and items would become demons once they are ancient enough\"...\\nFollowing the alien-colored light band, one can walk deeper past the Forge and arrive at the hypergravity field created by the Pseudo Sun. Mortals struggle to endure a stellar density of this degree. It is an inwardly collapsing disorder that only Disattva artisans can traverse with ease.\\nThe scorching stellar surges and abnormal celestial phenomena prevent the curious from continuing on to approach the Pseudo Sun. All fundamental physical laws of the universe in this space have been augmented to a terrifying degree. Only one stout and powerful stellar race, the Disatta, can survive in a space with such gravitational abnormalities — Disatta are natural-born elite artisans. They pass between the Forge and the Pseudo Sun, and their perception of time has long strayed from that of normal beings. They still keep their promise and continue to improve their artisanship, forging the ship's enormous cannons and keeping watch over the Pseudo Sun's slumber. The Xianzhou Zhuming regard Disatta as loyal allies, respecting their tenacity and strength, while being grateful for their selfless sacrifice.\\nAnd yet, no being can follow the light bands further across the outlandish and twisted gravity field to reach deep into the Pseudo Sun. That is a forbidden place to all beings capable of emotion, a room where the endless dream of the Flint Emperor floats — The Xianzhou Zhuming is always on watch, for even the smallest sliver of emotional disturbances can awaken the boundless might of the heliobi progenitor.\\nThere are frequently individuals who ignore the warning and cast their gaze upon the Pseudo Sun from afar. They would unknowingly slip into the psychological gravitational field, and their smallest carelessness would result in their sentience being taken away by the torrential mirages that pour out like a tide. Different from interacting with the gentle illusions, staring upon that \"azure sun\" would only make one feel the boundless rage that has been suppressed since the beginning of time — \"The heliobi shall give the heroes power to scorch the very heavens, but when all duties have been fulfilled, the heroes must give to the heliobi supreme bodies forged into perfection...\" No one knows how this ancient oath could be fulfilled. Similarly, none knows when the Flint Emperor would awaken from its bottomless dream.\\nDeep within the lotus lantern's wick, the Pseudo Sun heaves a profound sigh in its unending sleep. The ship slowly sails across the sky, leaving behind only an iridescent trail. Just like this, the Xianzhou Zhuming will continue to ally with fire, travel with fire, and share its destiny with fire."

			"Oakley inherited this felt hat from her deceased father. Now that she tucked ears of wheat into the hat as ornaments, it looked much cuter than before. Bounty hunters, whether intentionally or not, always sought to craft emblems of their own, in the hope that these items could one day become the beginning of great legends.\\n\\nThe Interastral Peace Corporation offered bounties to enlist experts of the highest caliber to hunt down Interastral Pirates and Oakley, as one who always worked alone, forever sought out the most challenging regions of desolation among the farthest reaches of the world.\\n\\nDays under the scorching hot sun were coupled with bitterly cold nights. In her lonely odyssey, Oakley could fall asleep with her head pillowed on her felt hat whenever she was near a bonfire. All her dreams were intruded by a mysterious gunslinger, who claimed to be a bounty hunter from afar. His scrawny figure was in sharp contrast with his fiercely stern gaze. The gunslinger challenged Oakley's father to a duel to the death at high noon. Shots were fired, a felt-hat was dropped, and Oakley's father was falling backwards to the ground, followed by the sounds of weeping and wailing from Oakley's mother...\\n\\nLittle Oakley gawked at the gunslinger in stupor, whose aptitude with a gun was so superb that her father could never stand a chance.\\n\\nWaking up, there would be traces of damp tears on Oakley's felt hat. As a child, she learned how to shoot a gun only because she had wanted her father's handsome and stylish hat."

Late into the night, she finally took off her chest guard and wrote the name \"Ekat\" on the inside. She wants to swear she would achieve victory for this name. This was a key match in Lindsay's path to becoming the boxing champion, and her first fight without her coach by her side. Before Lindsay stepped into the ring, she held out her chest proudly to the camera.\\n\\n\"Lindsay.. I couldn't believe you share the same name with my daughter. I always thought I was done with the world for good when she passed, until I finally met you. Thank you, Lindsay.\"\\n\\n\"Protect me, Ekat.\" The most important name was right by her heart."

			"Nailscrap Town's bandits needed some means to defend their hard-earned water sources and junks, which was how the subpar banditry technology came to be. The powered armor was needlessly flamboyant, with its leg parts being the only functional section\\n\\n\"I need a whole set of fully powered armor, and now you are telling me all the sections above were all blown up!? Ask yourself if you dared to wear this set of greaves yourself!\"\\n\\nThe defenses of Nailscrap Town that happened every now and then boosted the wartime development of Sensory Technology. Once, a random idea hit the engineers. With some materials of unknown source, they produced a set of powered armor. Unfortunately, only the leg part of the first generation of that cheap powered armor has survived. Even after being greatly simplified, the greaves still allow their wearer to take off like a rocket — a mechanism that confuses engineers nowadays.\\n\\nAccording to the engineers, the design was completed in the limbo between dreams and reality. It was a once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece of sheer ingenuity.\\n\\nA useful piece of junk is a good piece of junk, be it recyclable or hazardous."

He had followed the labyrinth of smells, penetrating into the enemy's camp in the darkness of a lightless night, and crushed the skulls of his prey one by one... The borisin Warheads admire the concept of polished fangs, regarding them as blades and spears, symbols of the power and confidence to tear apart anything.\\n\\n\"The borisin Brood Lord gnashed and gnawed on flesh, devouring the blood of innocents. He is sentenced to a lifetime in a cage with his face covered in a closed-mouth muzzle, convicted of the Ten Unpardonable Sins.\"\\n\\nThe Warhead contemptuously looks around — the swordsmaster who engulfed everything like an icy sea of fury is not there...

Countless in quantity, they were difficult to store, and she couldn't be bothered to manage them herself.\\n\\nThe generous and charitable Interastral Peace Corporation then proposed a solution and that was how the Herta Space Station, where wisdom and secrets are stored, was born. Comprehensive containment measures were made throughout the space station, all in the pursuit of organizing everything in the collection with order and clarity. Phenomena were stored in specialized containers while Curios were regulated in indices. Innumerable items were categorized and classified, then stored deep within the station for research.\\n\\nThe IPC then proposed a collaboration in exploring the secrets of the stars together, which brought curious and adventurous scholars into the station to conduct research.\\n\\nMost of them admired Madam Herta, vowing to never abandon their ethereal aspirations and explore the secrets whispered among the stars. They investigated the star systems and realms of living beings, debated true justice in discourses on ethics and philosophies, outlined valleys and peaks within galaxies, deciphered secrets behind religious rituals and ceremonies, held on to the way of seeking truth from practice... They were the true believers of passing knowledge to posterity, and practiced unrestrained and divergent research.\\n\\nHowever, once the space station moved into orbit, it started to operate on its own and Madam Herta rarely showed herself. It was then that the IPC realized the whole station was filled with the mundane daily activities of the researchers, yet the genius was nowhere to be seen.\\n\\nLight from different zones rendered people unaware of the passage of time, the traces of which could only be detected in the burnt out lifestyle in the station. Often a smattering of researchers would argue non-stop about a particular piece of collection, even going so far as to start a fight. Occasionally a security officer would be absent from their daily patrol and nap instead on their military-styled bunker. Sometimes senior researchers would share with their younger peers tales of past romances, while some big shots would disguise themselves as temporary workers to bid their time for the next big turn of luck... Besides research, there was also life. They just had to look outside the hull — for the stars were journeying with them.\\n\\nDespite all the limitations, the researchers still talked about the everyday life in the space station in their own romantic way — The cosmos was a profound epic poem, and Herta Space Station was slowly cracking open the poetry collection."

In this lonely voyage, people slumbered, woke up, and slumbered again in incessant alternation... Star-chasing whales fell from the dome of heaven, and crystalline entities made of subgrain lattice managed to span light years without a single crack. The Elixir Seekers witnessed the majesty of various supernatural powers. In covert delight, they further hardened their resolve to obtain immortality.\\n\\nAfter voyaging for thousands of years, the Xianzhou Luofu gradually came to a halt, whereupon it encountered the master of Abundance in the limbo between the reality and the imaginary. Yaoshi bestowed a divine miracle upon the ship, and it immediately manifested as the Ambrosial Arbor. Its shade was as large as clouds, blocking out the sky and sun. Its roots were thick and dense, enveloping the entire Xianzhou ship — the Luofu seemed to be brought to life.\\n\\nThose who coveted immortality swallowed the fruit of the Ambrosial Arbor, and finally obtained the Endless Lifespan they had dreamed so much about. The Xianzhou residents began to claim they were celestial beings worthy of endless lifespans in abundance, and they also learned to use the Ambrosial Arbor to create various inhuman marvels via the blessings of immortality.\\n\\nYet, just like the shifting of the sun and moon, what once prospered was fated to decline and what once brought elation must eventually induce agony. It was not until the arrival of the Three Sufferings, when people were tormented to near extinction, that the Xianzhou people finally came to understand the true nature of this so-called miracle, which was nothing but harrowing calamity.\\n\\nIn the midst of disaster, a hero rose with the Reignbow and split the Ambrosial Arbor in half. The Xianzhou people regained their dignity as humans, and vowed to return to mortality and purge all deathless doom in this universe. In the ensuing years, Xianzhou went on a hunt across the stellar seas, taking it upon themselves to purge all deathless abominations. The foxians regained their freedom and took back control of the sky, while the Vidyadhara sealed off the contamination and any residual catastrophes. The three races were then brought together in a covenant and coalition. Thus was born the Xianzhou Alliance.\\n\\nProsperity and calamity came and went in cycles during the voyage. Heroes and legends rose to fame and glory one after another as history marched on. Now, the Xianzhou Luofu is healing and reconstructing in a period of hard-won peace. Free trade and open minds truly brought it back to life.\\n\\nImmortality had permanently molded the Xianzhou Luofu.

			"The master of Abundance buried the seed of karma in the center of the Xianzhou Luofu and gifted the Elixir Seekers with something named \"Ambrosial Arbor,\" which was considered a miracle as people were able to immediately understand its implications.\\n\\nThe Ambrosial Arbor grew fruits of divinity that brimmed with life and vitality, containing the Endless Lifespan sought by the Elixir Seekers. From that moment, the ancient taboos and laws were rendered useless, and nature's dictum and ethics regarding aging and death became irrelevant history. People followed the way of immortality to exploit the Ambrosial Arbor with increasing intensity, making Fallow Earth that never exhausted itself, molding their own bodies to shapeshift, and giving the gift of thinking and talking to animals... Innumerable unimaginable technologies were brought into existence under the branches of the Ambrosial Arbor.\\n\\nHowever, the Ambrosial Arbor took off its disguise as time went by, revealing its hideous visage as the agony of immortality crept upon the immortals.\\n\\nThe celestials ceaselessly reproduced, yet tasted no death. The ship groaned from overpopulation, as hunger and starvation tormented many. Xianzhou's young can never realize their life's ambitions while their elders clang to power, and society teetered at the edge of structural collapse... Rebellions of the aurumatons and external invasions marked a ruinous millennium, after which the darkness hidden in immortal bloodlines also showed its face. The so-called \"Body of Celestials\" was simply a technology that surpassed human intellect. The propensity to be stricken with mara was a warning to all Xianzhou natives, a reminder that they were a mere step away from becoming abominations themselves.\\n\\nIn desperation, a hero tore through the sky with a powerful shot from their bow, splitting the Ambrosial Arbor in half... Yet even if all there was left of the Ambrosial Arbor was a burnt stump, the fate of Xianzhou could never be separated from it.\\n\\nIt attracted external forces to invade Xianzhou. The Abominations of Abundance launched multitudes of assaults, where flesh was distorted and blood was spilled, for the sole purpose of devouring Xianzhou whole. The Arbor also tempted the Xianzhou residents. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus broke the taboos and ventured deep into the secret of Abundance within the Ambrosial Arbor, hoping to reforge the once mighty immortal empire... In the long days of foreign and domestic troubles, the remaining corpus of the Ambrosial Arbor lurked like unending vines propagating in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to wreak havoc again.\\n\\nFortunately, the Xianzhou Luofu never lowered its guard against the withered tree. The people had vowed to cast this source of all distortions into the end of all things."

Those who claimed to have received the oracle of the god began to act, wishing to help the Aeon Qlipoth to build the wall.\\n\\nThe universe is in imminent peril, and the building of the wall cannot wait. The puny humans had no intention of imitating the feats of the god, instead gathering into a self-proclaimed \"support team\" for the Aeon, willing to devote everything to the Amber Lord. With the power of Preservation, the support team piloted their fleet to different stellar systems to purchase building materials such as stone, wood, gold, and supernium, then tirelessly transported these to the subspace barrier, piling the items on the planetary wasteland.\\n\\nAfter the end of the short development period, the support team took a firm foothold in Pier Point and established the Interastral Peace Corporation. In order to fully carry out their devotion, they turned their sights to deep space.\\n\\nLouis Fleming raised a call for action, and the long-distance trade fleet left the star systems adjacent to Aeon Qlipoth. Their commodities were no longer limited to building materials... They plan to connect the whole Cosmos and trade everything. Soon after, Dongfang Qixing implemented Cosmos-wide trade regulations and built a \"credit\" system to set a price for everything across the universe. Trillions of assets gathered under their megastructure on Pier Point. Like a silent black hole, the building destroyed people's notions about the limits of wealth.\\n\\nToday, the ships of the Interastral Peace Corporation are all over the Cosmos. Despite being criticized as a corporate dictatorship, the IPC has not stopped expanding. They don't care what other people think and have never forgotten their founding mission.\\n\\nThe IPC's recruit training methods change with each passing day, but after nearly eight hundred Amber Eras, there is only one historical practice that never changed. Once upon a time, Louis Fleming, the founder of the IPC, stood in front of the support team and made a passionate speech. He put forward the aspiration of uniting the universe and supporting the Aeon's wishes to protect the universe. As soon as the speech ended, the distant and huge sound of a cosmic impact sounded, injecting a lofty calling into this solemn and sublime moment. From that moment on, they knew this would become their unswerving belief.\\n\\n\"All for the Amber Lord.\""

The two wise ones were determined to delve deeper into the cosmos, and thus the Interastral Peace Corporation was born. The IPC offered anything a planet could ever want, at fair prices pegged to their \"credits.\" Since then, the cosmos's trade route was founded, and all planets that join the IPC's business network can share the same currency, buy the same goods, and enjoy the same services.\\n\\nMerchant ships under the credit system travel between the stars, and the trade routes merge and separate to weave a pan-cosmic network.

The Aeon Qlipoth has no intention of accepting these eager gifts, instead always solely focused on the crisis that will befall the unsuspecting mortals, having to cast the gargantuan barriers measured in light years. The small organization that used to purchase materials has long since become a tremendous influence in the cosmos.

			"Regarding the origin of mechanical life, the carbon-based scholars of the Intelligentsia Guild have a unique speculation: A cluster of electrons born by chance.\\n\\nElectric currents flow throughout the atmosphere and ground. It separated into secondary forms of different magnitudes under the countless acts of gravity and repulsive forces. According to the scholars' hypothesis, this action is tantamount to cell division in carbon-based life. Thereafter, currents randomly output different potentials via the transistor structure naturally formed on the planetary surface, creating the most primitive program. The proud scholars argued that in this way, machines have \"thoughts\" that are comparable to carbon-based life.\\n\\nA mechanic objected to this: How can carbon-based life, which has not even been able to understand the origin of their own beings, have the gall to spout such fallacies? As soon as the words came out, the academic world of the universe was shaken to the core. Mechanical life began to re-examine the arrogant \"carbon-based centrism\" and examine its own origin.\\n\\nHowever, the Screwllumites on the Planet Screwllum had no choice but to pause their march — their planet's energy was being exhausted faster than their inspiration circuits. They needed to first find a way for their population to survive.\\n\\nIn the end, they decided to carry out an extreme plan that transcended several Amber Eras: They used the dying planet as fuel to power the Celestial Differentiator. The awe-inspiring, gigantic gear tirelessly processed the punched tape, methodically repeating calculations. With its planetary energy supply, the huge machine simulated a bona fide and stable superecosystem. They would then build their new home around this parent star.\\n\\nWith their planetary crisis lifted, the Screwllumites could rest. Always rational, optimistic, and elegant, they are determined to explore the answer to their origins in a purely rational manner.\\n\\nThe massive system is filled with the sound of bearings grinding against each other, and the dense teeth of cogs drive the punched tape to churn out data. One branch flows into multiple branches, and countless branches guide trillions of gears to roar... Then, these branches collapse again and again, falling into the furnace and returning to silence in the bubbling core. Over a long period of time, the programmed super-ecosystem gradually became a wonderful and relatively stable one. Eventually, speculations about the origins of machines began to cause Screwllumites' imaginations to wander.\\n\\nThe steel construct that drives the dying star once again activated their intelligent thought circuits.

The ring system with dense square holes pierced up from the back of the planet. Everything the planet supports was situated on the strip, revolving quietly with the engine as its axis, day after day. He had seen the despairingly absurd nature of this planetary system: An elegant string of state transient equations, a giant, icy cylinder — that's all Planet Screwllum is, nothing more.\\n\\nAccording to his interpretation of the equations, at the birth of the Celestial Differentiator, its lead creator tried to explain the origin of the universe as a cellular automaton and its recursion, and Planet Screwllum itself was a result of the game of life.\\n\\nScrewllumites and other inorganic life on the planet acted as the \"cells\" in this automaton, while also being smaller-scale cellular automatons.

It had once been neatly lined up on a starship until one hasty escape attempt of the starship led to a huge shock wave, which subsequently exposed the wire to the moisture in the air.\\n\\nThe entire starship was dragged into a labyrinth of underground passages. On the thieves' starship, shields made of steel plates were removed layer by layer, and the power lines were crudely stripped apart, all of which were then used to build the first-ever alliance market. The thieves there began to accumulate wealth and at the same time started to talk about their ideals. Soon after, the protracted infighting began, where suspicion and betrayal were expressed by and against one another. The flames of the war fought between the dictator and their detractors eventually spread from the underground tunnel to the surface-level desert grounds...\\n\\nThis exposed wire was even older. It was dug out of a pothole by the bandits and then connected to a revamped overland vehicle with air leaking in from all directions, which was driven to a distant water source.\\n\\nThe top priority for all survivors of the war of betrayal was to locate Talia's water sources. They drove thousands of miles a day on deserts littered with glass shards in extremely shabby and poorly made vehicles. The caravans of the bandits sometimes chased each other, raising dust and heavy smoke, and other times they just wantonly threw people on or off the car... The sheer pressure of survival forced them to give up all other thoughts. Only by forging ahead could they be saved from confusion.\\n\\nThis naked wire was always old. It was further removed from the overland vehicle and placed into the town's lightbox by the bandits. The aging wire caused the lights to flicker frequently.\\n\\nIt was an old gangster who claimed to be the \"police officer\" who founded the original Nailscrap Town. With his strongarm tactics and charisma, he managed to keep the junkyard in good order. The town became livelier than ever. Eccentric engineers accidentally made machinery out of waste, and desperate wastelanders also enjoyed fighting back and forth in the underground arena... Late at night in a bar, they filled their glasses with grape juice that smelled like gasoline and cheered together, celebrating the fact that they had managed yet another day of survival.\\n\\nThere was nothing new in Talia, just old things repurposed differently in changing times."

			"Vonwacq is a small and crowded planet, almost entirely covered by rainforests and islands, with its exuberant wildlife being its most recognizable feature.\\n\\nVonwacq's effervescent vitality made the rainforests near its equator grow so large and tall that their shades would cover the sky above and even block out the sun. The lack of sunlight in the undergrowth of the rainforest throughout the year creates a perfect space for fungi and other low-light plants to grow. Intelligent creatures inhabited regions near the tropics. Plants, irrespective of height, would grow naturally here. Fresh fruits and vegetables could be picked at any time and anywhere, which was what the locals mostly fed on.\\n\\nHowever, be it the new immigrants or the indigenous Wacqwacq beings, they have always maintained a quasi-religious reverence for the animal fruits growing on the Thestang tree.\\n\\nThe great Thestang tree never stopped bearing fruit, not even for a moment. With time, all those yellowish and translucent oval-shaped fruits grew larger and heavier, hanging down from the branches until the stems could no longer bear their weight. When the time came, fruits would fall to the ground with a loud and crisp sound, cracking their thin skin and releasing whatever was held within. The fauna of Vonwacq was all born this way, be it fish, birds, or polar bears. On Planet Vonwacq, creatures of all kinds shared one common birth mother.\\n\\nThe fiend known as the \"Demon King\" was also born from one such fruit of the Thestang tree. From the moment of its birth, it instinctively knew how to swing its giant ax-like pincers toward others, waging war upon the entire biosphere of Vonwacq.\\n\\nEvery sixty natural years, the Thestang tree would give birth to a new demon king, and the cycle went on and on. The people of Vonwacq had long been used to and prepared for such cyclical fates of doom. Whenever a demon king's awakening approached, they would temporarily set aside their disputes and work together, assembling their strongest warriors to set sail for Wacq Island... One sixty years after another sixty years, these seemingly pointless crusades had been launched over and over again for hundreds of years in such narrow landscapes on this small planet. The demon kings were the permanent disaster of Vonwacq, and the caches of civilization were periodically wiped out.\\n\\nThus, it could be said that Planet Vonwacq was more like a stagnating pool of dead water, even though it was teeming with lively creatures that were ceaselessly fighting with each other, seemingly full of possibilities for change."

Then these creatures awakened, cried, and subsequently left Wacq Island to seek a habitat of their own on Planet Vonwacq.\\n\\nAt first, the outsiders from the stars were seen as reckless thieves who, upon receiving a \"friendly\" tribal welcome, began to understand the civilizational dilemma of Vonwacq. Soon after, the outsiders boarded the locals' boats and sailed to Wacq Island, curious about how a demon king would be born from the fruit. The tribal warriors lay low on the shoals in trepidation, closely clenching their Stone Age weapons. To fight for sixty years of peace, they seemed determined, ready to make the ultimate sacrifice, one where they may never return home.\\n\\nAs the war went on, the outsiders discovered the truth about the \"Demon King\" — It was a species of interstellar worm that had once been considered extinct. It was simply unexpected that these creatures would appear in such a form in this corner of the universe.\\n\\nWhen the brutal expedition was finally over, the surviving few natives left the coastline with news of their victory, while the curious outsiders quietly stayed behind. They pushed aside the drooping branches of the giant tree and sank into the quagmire, almost half-submerged. In the sunken lands of the rainforest, the outsiders found a control cabin. It was then that the secret of Vonwacq was finally revealed — the Thestang tree turned out to be the eco genesis system from a much higher civilization, which could decode and then release innumerable life forms to restore the planet's biosphere.\\n\\nThe demon king that cyclically rampaged the planet turned out to be just one single piece of data in the vast biologic database. The outsiders deleted the data of the demon king and then left Vonwacq, not seeking any credit or gratitude from the locals.\\n\\nThe sound of tidal waves battering against the seaside land was the only audible sound on the coastline of Wacq Island. The indigenous coalition forces of Vonwacq were all lined up and were convinced that the demon king would never come again. Then they cheered, toasted, sang, and talked all night about a future without demon kings. However, almost immediately after the two allied tribes bid farewell and returned to their respective homelands, the two tribes began plotting wars for their takeover of the whole of Vonwacq... Without a common threat such as the demon king, their alliance was but a non-binding piece of paper. The small planet was never designed to withstand a conflict between the two tribes. And the short-lived, fragile peace had since shattered out of existence.\\n\\nThe coastline of Wacq Island remained in its enigmatic calm as if nothing had ever transpired on these shores. With humans and Wacqwacq gone from its center stage, Vonwacq had finally reclaimed peace and completed its ecological restoration."

Out here, the exiles' desire to be recalled intensified to a boiling point. Assessors wearing propulsion equipment fought for high-quality parts below-deck for many years, their lightning-fast figures mutually fleeing from and in pursuit of each other in the corridors of sunken ships.

In the dreams that these warriors are woven into, the sole meaning of their existence is to guard Titania and her \"empire.\" In their short lives, they studied, fought, received the Empress' commands, faced the enemy fearlessly, and died with honor.\\n\\nNo one knew when this falsehood was revealed. Was it from the day when the old humans in Glamoth's territories fell below a certain percentage? Was it the day when scientists realized that the Empress was beginning to revolt against her captivity? Or... maybe the day when the Swarm's onslaught dissipated into thin air?\\n\\nAll the people knew was that the Iron Cavalry gave their all for the non-existent \"empire.\" After decades of bloody battles, the remains of mechas and insect limbs turned into dense debris strewn throughout Glamoth's star system, connecting with each other to form a \"River of Death.\" When the remnants of the Swarm no longer posed a threat and the leaders of the council rang the bell of peace, informing the citizens that they had dispelled the apocalypse that clouded the heavens and the republic would be ushered back into the light of day — What arrived was not daylight, but the beginning of another sunless night.\\n\\nAfter that, the civilization known as Glamoth faded away, and the long-awaited peace came to the empty stars. The long river of stardust and debris flows silently along the void."

			"The attendants bow and salute with uniform smiles, and greet the guests with music: \"Welcome to the Planet of Festivities! Beautiful dreams await you.\" The guests smile as they move forward, accepting their drinks infused full of bubbles and gulping them down.\\n\\nThe scenery gradually becomes more and more incredulous, and the senses feel as if one has been lifted by silk. Guests from other lands defy gravity and walk on walls. Strange toys come to life and roam the streets in celebration. The water from the spring turn into a giant whale and swim through the halls. Opening a window no longer show a view of the stars in the deep sky, but of the city's shifting streams of light and shadows, holding up the constant echoes of giant clocks and theaters. The guests finally realize that they were never awake, but are instead witnessing Penacony's true nature in a dream — a place where time stops in a neverending dreamscape.\\n\\nEveryone knows that, under the rule of \"The Family,\" the doors of Penacony are open to everyone amidst the stars. For a transcendent experience, for an inspirational excitement, for the soothing of worries and wounds — guests of the highest caliber come to surrender their pain in exchange for peace and tranquility, to drink the best of the best, and to wander in the sea of dreams. Some spend unforgettable holidays here and leave content, while others become obsessed with the festivities and settle down here. The star-studded hotel is the jewel of dream weavers, the kingdom of dream makers, and the playground of dream seekers.\\n\\nFew guests are aware of the dusty history of the past — the thread that weaves the dreams comes from reality. The velvety splendor of today's Penacony was born of salty rust, heavy shackles, and deprived freedom. The Planet of Festivities was once an IPC prison, where countless inmates were relocated to salvage the overflowing Memory Bubbles for the Garden of Recollection. People repeated their endless toils until their bodies were as heavy as lead, but their souls became as light as bubbles. At some unknown point in time, the small cells cut off access to reality, but people's consciousnesses became linked in dreams. In the midnight bell, that shared dream seemed so real, reflecting the sheer hypocrisy of reality.\\n\\nIt lasted until the Destruction melted the chains of the IPC, the Trailblaze connected this frontier to the other stars, and the Harmony arrived upon invitation to sow the seeds of peace. Freedom finally broke ground and added a new name to the original dream — Penacony.\\n\\nToday, there is no trace of the crumbling prison. In the dream world, a myriad of skyscrapers has been erected and the desert has been rebuilt and transformed into a metropolis — a new world for dreamers in search of wealth and opportunities, and a utopia for those in search of indulgence and pleasure. The past of the Planet of Festivities is like a photo that fell to the bottom of a cupboard — it exists, but is seen by no one.\\n\\nNowadays, the land of dreams is filled with songs of joy, and the noise of the past have been relegated to gossip, silently lost in the interlude of a comedy, in the behind-the-scenes of some cartoon, or in the side column of some magazine."

			"Those who have visited Penacony will agree that \"built on dreams\" is not just some saying, but is a very real statement. The opulent hotel is just the tip of the iceberg of the Planet of Festivities, and it is only when you \"stay and dream\" that you are considered to have officially arrived at Penacony. From then on, the land of dreams, consisting of twelve dreamscapes, slowly expands before the guests' eyes.\\n\\nGuests who are new to the place may be overwhelmed by this carnival stage, but do not be alarmed. Look up and see the metal tracks crisscrossing the skyscrapers and the Spheroids rapidly rolling along them. They are the most visible means of transportation in this dreamscape metropolis and guide guests to each and every place around the city.\\n\\nStarting from the central station, the complicated Spheroid tracks are like the blood vessels of the metropolis. Whether it is the underground tunnels of the Moment of Daybreak, the vast fields of the Moment of Scorchsand, or the glittering stadium of the Moment of Stars, the colorful Spheroids roll on and on, delivering people to each station accurately, efficiently, safely, and comfortably, pouring a sleepless energy into the dream world of Penacony.\\n\\nDreams give a light and delicate texture to everything, and the nut-like Spheroids are regarded as both vehicles and as toys in the land of dreams. However, few remember that the Spheroids are actually imprisonment cages — the vehicle towards dreams are tools originally used for locking up prisoners.\\n\\nA long time ago, the IPC sent a huge number of prisoners to the Asdana star system in an attempt to stop a catastrophe from spreading. There, people reclaimed memoria, gradually becoming lost between fantasy and reality. The spherical work chambers in vacuum became an unforgettable \"memory\" for the prisoners — the hard curved interior walls, the awful experience of tumbling around, the unbearable daily attendance — perhaps these pains ran too deep. When those who regained their freedom pioneered the barren dreamscape, the spherical cages came along with them.\\n\\nBut now, unlike in the past, peace and freedom have given birth to optimism. Instead of trying to destroy the inescapable nightmares over and over, it is better to add to them the color this place should have, to take them in, and embrace them. So, the spherical imprisonment cages of the past have become today's Spheroids.\\n\\nIn the present, the fast-moving colorful Spheroids moving all over Penacony and the slight reverberations coming from within them... are all quietly hidden in the light of the dream city, blending in with the ambitions and laughter, like a land of dreams where time forever stands still."

Within just two years, this young fanatic conquered the bitter cold, pestilence, and death, and managed to address three major longstanding issues that had plagued the Department for several Amber Eras. One of these challenges is the desolate planet known as Sigonia-IV, which is covered in barren deserts and scarred by clan vendettas... a place of harsh conditions and strife.\\n\\nSituated near the convergence of three major star clusters, Sigonia-IV has long been subjected to stellar winds from multiple stars, earning its reputation as the \"eye of the storm\" throughout the Cosmos. The planet's surface environment is extremely harsh, leading many civilizations to either migrate to other celestial bodies or succumb to natural disasters. Now, only a small number of intelligent races remain there, referred to as Sigonians by scholars from the Intelligentsia Guild.\\n\\nIn reality, Sigonians have fragmented into numerous clans, with most adopting nomadic lifestyles, while a few have established centralized systems of governance of reasonable size.\\n\\nThey share a common language. Through the translation provided by the Synesthesia Beacon, you will learn that \"Katica\" means \"shellslasher,\" who have a reputation of being the most ferocious clan among Sigonians. And \"Avgin\" means \"honey,\" who are often accused of pilfering by those willfully ignorant. These clans share a vendetta that lasted through Amber Eras, engaged in a cycle of bloody vengeance in the boundless wilderness where only the fittest survive — until mysterious figures clad in black descended from the sky. From there, Sigonians were briefly united under the radiance of Amber, and the natural cycles that were finally reached a temporary conclusion.\\n\\nAfterward, under the IPC's guidance, the Sigonians established the Sigonian Sovereignty according to the Interstellar Peace Charter and took their first steps toward the wider Cosmos.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this unity and progress did not extend to the Avgins and Katicans. Some malicious opportunists among the Sigonians viewed the former's resourcefulness with suspicion, while slandering the latter as nothing more than predators with no hope of enlightenment. Although they possessed only limited knowledge about Preservation, they understood that some of them had to be sacrificed for it. Utilizing a highly advanced set of parliamentary rules, these devious and corrupt individuals banished both clans to the endless desert.\\n\\nAs a token of apology, they even went out of their way to declare that \"the Avgins shall forever retain the right to autonomy\" — In other words, should any future conflicts occur between the two clans, they could justifiably and lawfully sit back and do nothing."

However, these inborn talents are the exact reason they draw jealousy and ire from others. And the envious and snobbish soon begin their ceaseless slander, and the baseless defamation of the Avgins thus spreads like wildfire throughout the cosmos. As mere rumors can suffice to tarnish the sanctity of truth, the Avgins, a people of a peripheral world, found themselves assailed without recourse, subject to all manners of suspicion and prejudice.\\n\\nThe Avgins have an appreciation for intricately patterned fabrics, as well as a penchant for jewelry crafted from precious gemstones. They're particularly fond of turquoise meteorites, the only kind of gemstones capable of rivaling the resplendence of Gaiathra Triclops' divine body, which in their mythology is believed to have been reborn from death.\\n\\nKnown as Fenge Biyos, their Mother Goddess reigns over all matters related to fertility, travels, and trickery. Depictions of the Mother Goddess in the Avgins' religion often portray her as a left palm adorned with three eyes. The Avgins primarily express reverence for her through spoken prayers alone, believing that the Mother Goddess is as silent and unassuming as the mountains of Sigonia, and that crafting statues or composing hymns for her would only distance themselves from her protective embrace.\\n\\nThe Avgins view the world through the body of the Mother Goddess — the earth, the mountains, and all that exists on the land are a part of the Mother Goddess' divine body. And at the end of each calendar year, her divine body will perish.\\n\\nOn that significant day, her divine essence ascends as a resplendent aurora in the night sky and is reborn in the following day. Hence, Avgins celebrate the first day of the new year through their grand festival called \"Kakava.\" During this festival, they weave sacrificial vessels known as \"Knots of Cyclicality\" and toss them into bonfires to commemorate the Great Goddess' birth.\\n\\nAccording to the incident report by the Marketing Development Department, that shocking conflict took place on a night of Kakava. It was a stormy night when the clouds and fog engulfed the northern lights, which should have been seen as an ill omen. However, the Avgin people were unexpectedly excited. When questioned about this, a maiden from the clan provided the following response.\\n\\n\"Rain is a gift from the Mother Goddess. SHE is calling to us, urging us to take up arms and fight for our future.\"\\n\"This rain accompanies us. This rain protects us. It is in this rain that we shall meet our honorable demise.\""

Those who looked down named the land below \"Izumo.\" Those who looked up named the world above \"Takamagahara.\" One day uninscribed in the annals, the Yaoyorozu no Kami descended from Takamagahara. These demonic beasts named Kami overturned the skies, burned the rivers and oceans, and shattered the land — People realized in horror that it was not an invasion for rulership, dominance, or plunder. The evil Kami came only to kill.\\n\\nAs the planet stood on the brink of death, Izumo embarked on a Kami-slaying journey, exhausting the might of the entire country to slay the calamity named \"Sovereign of Revelation\" and forging the very first Edict Edge using its bestial body. Giving the Kami a taste of their own medicine, the wielder of these swords can recite the mantra contained within the blade to master the divine power of Takamagahara, and use it to combat the evil Kami and save the masses. From then on, Izumo started its long and arduous crusade, exchanging inordinate lives lost for the fall of one Kami after another, shattering countless mortal blades to forge the twelve Sentinels.\\n\\nIn the merciless fight for survival, Izumo used the might of the Edict Edges to light up their uncivilized world of darkness in less than ten Amber Eras, building cities of dazzling neon lights. That distant Takama Divine Realm, once so far away, became so close within their reach — Yet history suddenly stopped there. The existence of the two planets instantly evaporated, disappearing into nothingness.\\n\\nNowadays, the past of the border planet Izumo can only be gleaned from the scattered whispers in the universe. Academics hold various views regarding its disappearance, but none can solve the mystery. Izumo's history should have been a long flowing river, but it was severed in one cut, and all its past and future voided on emptiness' other shore.

Was it yet another appalling experiment by Dr. Primitive, or was it a sign of the Voracity returning from the end of the Cosmos?\\n\\nOnly that pitch-black great sun knows the answer, yet THEY remain silent, never speaking.\\n\\nBecause everything that had happened will one day regress to the end, and everything that had ended is guaranteed to happen again.

			"The beginning of ancient foxian and borisin ballads all nostalgically sing of the \"Planet of Verdant\" and the planet's fertile soil and pleasant climate. However, upon closer inspection, the perceptive ones will realize such words are mere preludes to the eternal theme of \"war.\"\\nWith their talents for agriculture and commerce, some fox clans built prosperous towns next to flowing rivers. Meanwhile, the children of wolves roamed with their herd under the aurora-covered sky within the lush grasslands, forming settlements that dotted the landscape. The merchants laughed at the herders for the latter's savagery, while the herders despised the merchants for their deception. However, they both must confront the cruel torments of nature — the \"Vulpesummer\" and \"Lupuswinter.\"\\nIn the summer of rich harvests blessed by the fox deity, the two clans put down their arms and ceased warfare in mutual satisfaction. But once the wolf deity lets fall the white frost, the snowlines would spread from the poles and hunger shall drive the two clans to unceasing conflict.\\nThe ballads mention that the Lupuswinter once stayed far beyond its due, even after the sun of the old verdant home had circled the planet thirty-three times. Poverty and hunger crashed the people, and they resorted to even eating animals they once worshipped as totems. After foreseeing the end where the entire world shall be covered in bleak death, a savior climbed to the peak of the tallest mountain in that world — The foxian legends called this lady Tushan, but the borisin sagas called this man Duran. No matter what this savior was called, they made a wish to the Master of Immortality, hoping for sustenance enough to keep the world's people alive. Then, the mountains split, and sweet divine nectar of Redspring poured out from the hilly ravines.\\nThose who drank from the Redspring obtained power, dexterity, and strength from the beast meat they devoured. Their blood, too, stirred with the ferocity of animals, and their bodily forms became increasingly bestial — Thus was this world changed, never to return to its former days.\\nWith the Redspring as the medium, everything that the reborn canine races needed was made from this miraculous source — The fields no longer grew grain but viscorpi instead, and the garments that covered people's bodies were no longer of linen but of embryonic flesh. Even the chilly snowlands that once terrified the old verdant home civilizations were no longer a concern, for the canine races cultivated biological membranes in the polar regions to craft into warm dome-shaped tents, blocking the impoverished Lupuswinter beyond this barrier.\\nThen, things changed in the Planet of Verdant, just like how things changed for every short-life species that became long-life — There was a population explosion, ecological collapse, internal warfare... And no matter how hard the canine races prayed to the Master of Immortality, they never heard another reply. Then, the people understood the truth: Everything that the Master of Immortality could give has been given, and if the people wish to have better lives, they must take it themselves.\\nGathered around Duran the great Brood Lord, the canine races cast their sight into the sky where the Master of Immortality dwelled. The stars sparkled like a grassland waiting to be conquered with fast steads, and they will bring the \"Lupuswinter\" to the civilizations on those planets.\\nMuch later, their sworn enemies gave them the name \"borisin,\" for \"boris\" meant \"wolf\" in the language of the Planet of Verdant."

Mechabeasts that consumed the conquered as their feed had astounding agility, perception, and ferocity — Yet they were considered mere sheep when faced against their future masters. As the moonlight stirred the violent blood in their veins, the borisin youths chased and dueled against the mechabeasts. Some would die from the beast's kiss — That would be the result of cowardice. Some would kill their peers — That was the law of how valiant beasts shall be distributed... The borisin youths tripped the desired mount to the ground and tied the bridle, inlaid with neural spike whips, onto the animal's neck — The beast would be stunned through telepathy with its future master and became as tame as they have received hundreds of whiplashes. When the beast willingly carried the master on its back, a fitting borisin sorya (warrior, rider) would have been born.\\nThen, the borisin bridle would become the recorder of wars, and the reins would gradually become full of scratches, knots, and accessories.\\nThe well-trained sorya would don jellyfish-like membranous armor under the leadership of a yonda (leader, centurion). They would then board the beast ships that can warp between stars, explore different worlds, and swear to make the stars into their herding ground in the name of Duran and the Master of Immortality. On the bridle, light scratches indicated how many enemies the owner had slain, knots recorded how many major campaigns they were involved in, and the accessories dangling from the reins were loot such as human teeth and Intellitron cores obtained from pillaging frenzies... They were the vengeance and wails of the conquered, as well as medals for borisin individuals to demonstrate their strength.\\nWhen the mounts beneath the warrior perished in warfare, or when borisin wished to mete out punishment, the bridle would also be fastened around the face of other living beings.\\nTheir targets were usually foxians — The slave race excluded from the clan due to genetic selection plans. They were weak, devious, and were only fit for lowly labor and calculations. Whenever rare war-like individuals emerged among the foxians, the master of the wolf-head would prioritize binding these foxians with the bridles, driving them as war slaves to serve as vanguards on the battlefield.\\nIf all slaves had died, and the weapons were bent, then the bridle could still act as a whip if one attached a spike to the end. If the bridle was snapped and the warrior perished in war with their fangs and claws shattered, then the bridle would become the sole remaining epitaph and memories for borisin...\\nJust as the old tales said that \"the position between the predator and prey often changes in the forest,\" countless wolf-kind bridles have broken and snapped after fighting for millennia against the Xianzhou in this dark forest called the universe. At the end, this link that connected various clans was severed by the sharp arrow of The Hunt, and borisin also fell into the shadow of internal strife and general decay, becoming ever more removed from their former pride."

			"The Xianzhou Zhuming had floated in the starry seas for over eight millennia after setting sail from the Primeval Imperium. If one were able to view a chronological snapshot of how the starship's form had changed, it would be a very romantic experience — The colossal ship swallowed a deep-blue star, peeled off the worn hull layer by layer, swelled as a brimming bud, and finally bloomed into a lotus.\\nFrom space, the entire Xianzhou Zhuming appears as a lotus lantern of filigree gold. The giant glowing \"lotus leaves\" gradually spread out around the \"light poles\" and are bathed in a soft blue glow, being indeed worthy of poems that declare it \"A ship whose hull deceives the eyes, a lotus whose petals like candles glow.\" The \"lampstand\" section at the center of the ship is a spherical cage, its size on the magnitude of a celestial object. It tightly wraps around the azure sun, the \"lantern wick,\" and eternally spins. This mega structure is the most important location for the Xianzhou Zhuming's manufacturing industry — the Flamewheel Forge.\\nIn the past, the Zhuming Grand Artisan Yang Di had received a weapon mold from the anonymous sovereign of the Primeval Imperium as a gift when the fleet set off on their voyage. Thousands of years later, though the fleet has now changed beyond recognition with their immortality and the return voyage will never occur, the tradition of the Grand Artisan never died. In the Xianzhou Zhuming, artisanship is the supreme school of learning. All its generals also held the title of the Artisanship Commission's Furnace Master. When they left the ship, they commanded thousands of troops. When they returned to the ship, they would swing their hammer and forge wondrous items, and receive the people's supreme respect. More than half of the weapons used in the Xianzhou's hunts throughout the fleet's history were forged in the Xianzhou Zhuming. Therefore, the Flamewheel Forge came to be regarded as the holy pilgrimage site for such technologies in the entire Cosmos.\\nMetalsmithing is a measure of the advance of civilizations, while flames mark the beginning of civilizations. Many civilizations, while in their infancy, were most troubled with the problem of energy sources. The people spared no effort in discovering energy sources that would support their civilization to new heights. The Xianzhou Zhuming had stepped over this limitation — By imprisoning the progenitor of heliobi, the Flint Emperor, the artisans have obtained a literally inexhaustible power source. The Flamewheel Forge has intricate branch-like track systems that cover the star as much as possible, and the delicate boughs and leaves are choked with receptors and transmitters that guide the primal fire \"Flint Emperor\" to provide enough energy for all technological developments.\\nCountless artisans had regarded the Zhuming Artisanship Commission, which swallowed up a Pseudo Sun, as the hallowed halls of the craft. Apprentices who wanted to forge divine tools swarm the institution. With enough force, anything can be crafted, and the Flamewheel Forge has prepared everything the artisans could possibly need —\\nApprentices from different worlds come together in the Forge and become fellow students, then compete and share their skills. Outworlders who come in search of marvelous tools would also pay a hefty sum to entrust artisans into crafting otherworldly items — However, the countless apprentices over the millennia have rarely been favored by General Huaiyan, the \"Artisan of Artisans.\" Whenever he tutored students himself and personally passed on his skills both as a craftsman and a soldier, these students would either become grandmasters who left a mark in the annals as Furnace Masters or became Cloud Knights with names that thundered through the Alliance such as the Flamewheel Octet.\\n\"Forges wrought a million stars bright, irons craft heroes' soaring flight. Miniscule lights into martial might made, only with sharp blades are peace and plenty kept.\" From the day a Zhuming artisan received their tools, they must always remember — What they will spend their days and nights making are no simple weapons, but the arrows carrying the creed of The Hunt."

			"The Xianzhou Zhuming has always been accompanied by multicolored light bands while voyaging in deep space. These bands are energy outputs from super-high-temperature fusion reactions, as well as evidence that the Flint Emperor still burns and shall never die.\\nOn the outermost skirts of the aurora-inducing particles that are dispersed with the Flint Emperor's breaths, newborn heliobi slow down and wander into being. The Flamehunt Judges of the Zhuming Ten-Lords Commission then capture naive heliobi that have not had any contact with emotions, using kind and gentle dreams to tame the immature temperaments of such flames. Then, the judges pass these harmless heliobi to the Artisanship Commission's Temperaflame Office, which matches the heliobi with various artifacts to make them into lamps, vehicles, and various spectacles in Zhuming... However, in the eyes of the confused outworlders, these talking and walking items are proof of the rumor that \"divine essence exists everywhere in the delves, and items would become demons once they are ancient enough\"...\\nFollowing the alien-colored light band, one can walk deeper past the Forge and arrive at the hypergravity field created by the Pseudo Sun. Mortals struggle to endure a stellar density of this degree. It is an inwardly collapsing disorder that only Disattva artisans can traverse with ease.\\nThe scorching stellar surges and abnormal celestial phenomena prevent the curious from continuing on to approach the Pseudo Sun. All fundamental physical laws of the universe in this space have been augmented to a terrifying degree. Only one stout and powerful stellar race, the Disatta, can survive in a space with such gravitational abnormalities — Disatta are natural-born elite artisans. They pass between the Forge and the Pseudo Sun, and their perception of time has long strayed from that of normal beings. They still keep their promise and continue to improve their artisanship, forging the ship's enormous cannons and keeping watch over the Pseudo Sun's slumber. The Xianzhou Zhuming regard Disatta as loyal allies, respecting their tenacity and strength, while being grateful for their selfless sacrifice.\\nAnd yet, no being can follow the light bands further across the outlandish and twisted gravity field to reach deep into the Pseudo Sun. That is a forbidden place to all beings capable of emotion, a room where the endless dream of the Flint Emperor floats — The Xianzhou Zhuming is always on watch, for even the smallest sliver of emotional disturbances can awaken the boundless might of the heliobi progenitor.\\nThere are frequently individuals who ignore the warning and cast their gaze upon the Pseudo Sun from afar. They would unknowingly slip into the psychological gravitational field, and their smallest carelessness would result in their sentience being taken away by the torrential mirages that pour out like a tide. Different from interacting with the gentle illusions, staring upon that \"azure sun\" would only make one feel the boundless rage that has been suppressed since the beginning of time — \"The heliobi shall give the heroes power to scorch the very heavens, but when all duties have been fulfilled, the heroes must give to the heliobi supreme bodies forged into perfection...\" No one knows how this ancient oath could be fulfilled. Similarly, none knows when the Flint Emperor would awaken from its bottomless dream.\\nDeep within the lotus lantern's wick, the Pseudo Sun heaves a profound sigh in its unending sleep. The ship slowly sails across the sky, leaving behind only an iridescent trail. Just like this, the Xianzhou Zhuming will continue to ally with fire, travel with fire, and share its destiny with fire."

The church captured a newborn devil, trained her to become a valiant Solemn Knight, yet forbid her to ever reveal her true appearance, molded her to always obey the pontiff's order, and eventually made her the Maiden's silent knight.\\n\\nMaiden Vanira was of a similar age to Safina, and she was the one who guided Safina to learn the scriptures. To this day, Maiden Vanira could still remember the devil's profile in candlelight.\\n\\n\"My dear Safina, I have seen your face.

When the trumpets of arriving reinforcements finally sounded in the valley, that valiant company of heroes was long gone, and even their remains were nowhere to be found.

The boy stood upright in this old-fashioned uniform, representing those who had made the ultimate sacrifice.\\n\\nThe young Goethe junior saw uniforms and medals on that day, but the Supreme Guardian saw so much more.

			"Her eagle helmet had two pairs of auxiliary eyes, ensuring clear vision of her surroundings under any lighting conditions. However, these auxiliary eyes were now coated with dried, tainted blood, and everything within sight was tinged with rust.\\nThe general awoke from unconsciousness, rising from a mountain of corpses. Behind her, the Cloudpeer Telescope stood tall like a towering spire reaching into the sky. At the pinnacle of the tower, a radiant light pulsed incessantly, repeating cryptic messages that only stargazers could decipher. Sustained by the collective will of trillions within the Alliance, it was praying to the God — right now, she and her lifeless comrades who had long since laid down their lives were fighting for this whispered plea to reach the heavens and bestow death.\\n\"It's here...\" the general murmured softly, gazing upward. She couldn't see the form of the God or hear THEIR voice, but she could sense the evidence of THEIR arrival — waves of scorching air suddenly surged, like a branding iron skimming across her skin. Fiery sparks danced amidst the mist of blood, obscuring the sky like a curtain, which in the ensuing moment, was torn open by an unbearable light...\\nIt came, the miracle exchanged for the countless soldiers who perished. She had witnessed celestial remnants condemned by the God to the realm of death and had once pursued this light's trail in battle. She thought the light was extremely fast, too fast to entertain any stray thoughts. But she was wrong. That moment was enough for her to think of her beloved disciple again:\\n<i>\"Make a wish. Wish for her path to be clear...\"</i>\\nThe earth surged like angry waves, roaring with the sea of light, and she had no more worldly thoughts, transforming into dust within the light."

Countless in quantity, they were difficult to store, and she couldn't be bothered to manage them herself.\\n\\nThe generous and charitable Interastral Peace Corporation then proposed a solution and that was how the Herta Space Station, where wisdom and secrets are stored, was born. Comprehensive containment measures were made throughout the space station, all in the pursuit of organizing everything in the collection with order and clarity. Phenomena were stored in specialized containers while Curios were regulated in indices. Innumerable items were categorized and classified, then stored deep within the station for research.\\n\\nThe IPC then proposed a collaboration in exploring the secrets of the stars together, which brought curious and adventurous scholars into the station to conduct research.\\n\\nMost of them admired Madam Herta, vowing to never abandon their ethereal aspirations and explore the secrets whispered among the stars. They investigated the star systems and realms of living beings, debated true justice in discourses on ethics and philosophies, outlined valleys and peaks within galaxies, deciphered secrets behind religious rituals and ceremonies, held on to the way of seeking truth from practice... They were the true believers of passing knowledge to posterity, and practiced unrestrained and divergent research.\\n\\nHowever, once the space station moved into orbit, it started to operate on its own and Madam Herta rarely showed herself. It was then that the IPC realized the whole station was filled with the mundane daily activities of the researchers, yet the genius was nowhere to be seen.\\n\\nLight from different zones rendered people unaware of the passage of time, the traces of which could only be detected in the burnt out lifestyle in the station. Often a smattering of researchers would argue non-stop about a particular piece of collection, even going so far as to start a fight. Occasionally a security officer would be absent from their daily patrol and nap instead on their military-styled bunker. Sometimes senior researchers would share with their younger peers tales of past romances, while some big shots would disguise themselves as temporary workers to bid their time for the next big turn of luck... Besides research, there was also life. They just had to look outside the hull — for the stars were journeying with them.\\n\\nDespite all the limitations, the researchers still talked about the everyday life in the space station in their own romantic way — The cosmos was a profound epic poem, and Herta Space Station was slowly cracking open the poetry collection."

In this lonely voyage, people slumbered, woke up, and slumbered again in incessant alternation... Star-chasing whales fell from the dome of heaven, and crystalline entities made of subgrain lattice managed to span light years without a single crack. The Elixir Seekers witnessed the majesty of various supernatural powers. In covert delight, they further hardened their resolve to obtain immortality.\\n\\nAfter voyaging for thousands of years, the Xianzhou Luofu gradually came to a halt, whereupon it encountered the master of Abundance in the limbo between the reality and the imaginary. Yaoshi bestowed a divine miracle upon the ship, and it immediately manifested as the Ambrosial Arbor. Its shade was as large as clouds, blocking out the sky and sun. Its roots were thick and dense, enveloping the entire Xianzhou ship — the Luofu seemed to be brought to life.\\n\\nThose who coveted immortality swallowed the fruit of the Ambrosial Arbor, and finally obtained the Endless Lifespan they had dreamed so much about. The Xianzhou residents began to claim they were celestial beings worthy of endless lifespans in abundance, and they also learned to use the Ambrosial Arbor to create various inhuman marvels via the blessings of immortality.\\n\\nYet, just like the shifting of the sun and moon, what once prospered was fated to decline and what once brought elation must eventually induce agony. It was not until the arrival of the Three Sufferings, when people were tormented to near extinction, that the Xianzhou people finally came to understand the true nature of this so-called miracle, which was nothing but harrowing calamity.\\n\\nIn the midst of disaster, a hero rose with the Reignbow and split the Ambrosial Arbor in half. The Xianzhou people regained their dignity as humans, and vowed to return to mortality and purge all deathless doom in this universe. In the ensuing years, Xianzhou went on a hunt across the stellar seas, taking it upon themselves to purge all deathless abominations. The foxians regained their freedom and took back control of the sky, while the Vidyadhara sealed off the contamination and any residual catastrophes. The three races were then brought together in a covenant and coalition. Thus was born the Xianzhou Alliance.\\n\\nProsperity and calamity came and went in cycles during the voyage. Heroes and legends rose to fame and glory one after another as history marched on. Now, the Xianzhou Luofu is healing and reconstructing in a period of hard-won peace. Free trade and open minds truly brought it back to life.\\n\\nImmortality had permanently molded the Xianzhou Luofu. With its ups and downs through history, the Xianzhou Luofu accumulated its own unique aura that combined both antiquity and modernity.

From that moment, the ancient taboos and laws were rendered useless, and nature's dictum and ethics regarding aging and death became irrelevant history.

The Abominations of Abundance launched multitudes of assaults, where flesh was distorted and blood was spilled, for the sole purpose of devouring Xianzhou whole. The Arbor also tempted the Xianzhou residents. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus broke the taboos and ventured deep into the secret of Abundance within the Ambrosial Arbor, hoping to reforge the once mighty immortal empire... In the long days of foreign and domestic troubles, the remaining corpus of the Ambrosial Arbor lurked like unending vines propagating in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to wreak havoc again.\\n\\nFortunately, the Xianzhou Luofu never lowered its guard against the withered tree.

It separated into secondary forms of different magnitudes under the countless acts of gravity and repulsive forces. According to the scholars' hypothesis, this action is tantamount to cell division in carbon-based life. Thereafter, currents randomly output different potentials via the transistor structure naturally formed on the planetary surface, creating the most primitive program. The proud scholars argued that in this way, machines have \"thoughts\" that are comparable to carbon-based life.\\n\\nA mechanic objected to this: How can carbon-based life, which has not even been able to understand the origin of their own beings, have the gall to spout such fallacies? As soon as the words came out, the academic world of the universe was shaken to the core. Mechanical life began to re-examine the arrogant \"carbon-based centrism\" and examine its own origin.\\n\\nHowever, the Screwllumites on the Planet Screwllum had no choice but to pause their march — their planet's energy was being exhausted faster than their inspiration circuits. They needed to first find a way for their population to survive.\\n\\nIn the end, they decided to carry out an extreme plan that transcended several Amber Eras: They used the dying planet as fuel to power the Celestial Differentiator. The awe-inspiring, gigantic gear tirelessly processed the punched tape, methodically repeating calculations. With its planetary energy supply, the huge machine simulated a bona fide and stable superecosystem. They would then build their new home around this parent star.\\n\\nWith their planetary crisis lifted, the Screwllumites could rest. Always rational, optimistic, and elegant, they are determined to explore the answer to their origins in a purely rational manner.\\n\\nThe massive system is filled with the sound of bearings grinding against each other, and the dense teeth of cogs drive the punched tape to churn out data. One branch flows into multiple branches, and countless branches guide trillions of gears to roar... Then, these branches collapse again and again, falling into the furnace and returning to silence in the bubbling core. Over a long period of time, the programmed super-ecosystem gradually became a wonderful and relatively stable one. Eventually, speculations about the origins of machines began to cause Screwllumites' imaginations to wander.\\n\\nThe steel construct that drives the dying star once again activated their intelligent thought circuits.

The ring system with dense square holes pierced up from the back of the planet. Everything the planet supports was situated on the strip, revolving quietly with the engine as its axis, day after day.

The giant screen-like perforated belt was tireless, and the rectangular array filtered the late-night moonlight. Screwllum couldn't stop thinking. <i>Do ends to recursions really exist?</i> He thought. <i>What is the nature of inorganic life — or yet, what is the origin of the universe?</i>\\n\\n<i>Am I really willing to be only a witness to the ideas of my predecessors?</i>\\n\\n\"No,\" Screwllum concluded.

The lack of sunlight in the undergrowth of the rainforest throughout the year creates a perfect space for fungi and other low-light plants to grow. Intelligent creatures inhabited regions near the tropics. Plants, irrespective of height, would grow naturally here.

With time, all those yellowish and translucent oval-shaped fruits grew larger and heavier, hanging down from the branches until the stems could no longer bear their weight. When the time came, fruits would fall to the ground with a loud and crisp sound, cracking their thin skin and releasing whatever was held within. The fauna of Vonwacq was all born this way, be it fish, birds, or polar bears. On Planet Vonwacq, creatures of all kinds shared one common birth mother.\\n\\nThe fiend known as the \"Demon King\" was also born from one such fruit of the Thestang tree.

To fight for sixty years of peace, they seemed determined, ready to make the ultimate sacrifice, one where they may never return home.\\n\\nAs the war went on, the outsiders discovered the truth about the \"Demon King\" — It was a species of interstellar worm that had once been considered extinct. It was simply unexpected that these creatures would appear in such a form in this corner of the universe.\\n\\nWhen the brutal expedition was finally over, the surviving few natives left the coastline with news of their victory, while the curious outsiders quietly stayed behind. They pushed aside the drooping branches of the giant tree and sank into the quagmire, almost half-submerged. In the sunken lands of the rainforest, the outsiders found a control cabin. It was then that the secret of Vonwacq was finally revealed — the Thestang tree turned out to be the eco genesis system from a much higher civilization, which could decode and then release innumerable life forms to restore the planet's biosphere.\\n\\nThe demon king that cyclically rampaged the planet turned out to be just one single piece of data in the vast biologic database. The outsiders deleted the data of the demon king and then left Vonwacq, not seeking any credit or gratitude from the locals.\\n\\nThe sound of tidal waves battering against the seaside land was the only audible sound on the coastline of Wacq Island. The indigenous coalition forces of Vonwacq were all lined up and were convinced that the demon king would never come again. Then they cheered, toasted, sang, and talked all night about a future without demon kings. However, almost immediately after the two allied tribes bid farewell and returned to their respective homelands, the two tribes began plotting wars for their takeover of the whole of Vonwacq... Without a common threat such as the demon king, their alliance was but a non-binding piece of paper. The small planet was never designed to withstand a conflict between the two tribes. And the short-lived, fragile peace had since shattered out of existence.\\n\\nThe coastline of Wacq Island remained in its enigmatic calm as if nothing had ever transpired on these shores. With humans and Wacqwacq gone from its center stage, Vonwacq had finally reclaimed peace and completed its ecological restoration."

On this tiny planet, mountains of carbon fiber and stainless steel traced the pre-decommissioned outlines of giant ships, casting a shadow of emptiness over the steel ruins. Out here, the exiles' desire to be recalled intensified to a boiling point. Assessors wearing propulsion equipment fought for high-quality parts below-deck for many years, their lightning-fast figures mutually fleeing from and in pursuit of each other in the corridors of sunken ships. They had formed their own underground rules in the shadows... And yet none of these trapped beasts had their wishes fulfilled. No one was ever able to return.\\n\\nThe rules established by these abandoned humans, reduced to caged animals, did not escape the IPC's surveillance. Footage from their wearable cameras were transmitted back to the IPC and passed as after-dinner laughingstock by the high and powerful. The investor of the Traditional Project Department, however, scented out the faint possibility for \"entertainment\" after some consideration.\\n\\nWith this new plan, the first competition in the cosmos featuring the Taikiyan Roboball would have its glorious debut on planet Taikiyan. Several planet terraforming machines descended to the surface and yanked out the decommissioned spaceships in their entirety, not leaving a single inch of their former shadows behind. The obscure little planet had been transformed by the sport of Roboball, becoming a dazzling athletic hub in the blink of an eye. \"No one will care about its ludicrous beginnings by that time. There will only be pure sportsmanship and high-value commercial agreements.\"\\n\\nThe competition had athletes wearing propulsion equipment and armor, ever-changing three-dimensional race tracks, and physical clashes that sent sparks flying... The attention of the entire cosmos was thoroughly captured the moment the Roboball Competition was announced. From that moment forth, the planet once shrouded in darkness has never again seen a moment of night.\\n\\nBoth the home and visitor teams are evenly matched in the massive stadium, and the vociferous audience fills up the dome in countless multitudes. They roar the names of the team and the players, giving birth to a thunderous cacophony that does not end. Outside the dome, the planet is also bustling with activity as broadcast licenses, exclusive sponsorship, and advertising contracts are fought over in the trading market, while underground betting is rife as excitement and disappointment share the spotlight in equal measure... The inky shade of the night has long been transformed into a silent radium backdrop to the overflowing lights of the stadium.\\n\\nThe Taikiyan Stadium has been bright as day from the moment of its inauguration, and no one even remembers where the begone shadows are now hidden."

It constantly chases alterations of the Phase Flame, increasing the unpredictability of the game through its irregular movements. Sports equipment experts followed that by developing a standard-issue propulsion protective armor for Roboball games, allowing top sport equipment and medical organizations to better demonstrate their quality and ensuring the sustainability of a stable income and safe competition.\\n\\nAnd thus, the Taikiyan Roboball Association was formally established, and the initial version of the Taikiyan Roboball Game Rules was formulated. The game system comprising two teams with seven players each was also established from then on.\\n\\nThe track architects of the Intelligentsia Guild had turned the concept of \"racing\" into a three-dimensional circular track — the standard length of which is <unbreak>2.91</unbreak> kilometers. The flat central area of the track is 5 meters wide, and the curved areas on both sides range from 2 to <unbreak>14</unbreak> meters in width. The Roboball players will fly unidirectionally for several laps on the spacious and bright track, accompanied by the sound of whistling and collision, completing the entire game. According to actual testing, during high-speed travel on the track, disconnected point light sources will connect into lines with the athletes' visual persistence, and several dimly visible lumens will form an exclusive arclight track. Interastral Peace Entertainment invited the wealthy to participate in the league, promising them the exposure their favorite sport deserved. Subsequently, the league clubs were established, and the most talented players were assembled and ready to go.\\n\\nInterastral Peace Media had exclusive broadcasting rights for the event and, with the help of ultraremote sensing technology, they broadcasted the live competition far and wide. The sensory experience of top athletes was also recorded throughout the event, allowing homebound viewers to also experience the speed, collisions, whistles, and arclights of the competition from the comfort of their own homes. The old scuttling site was filled with sightseeing cruises and bustling crowds gathered in the streets, illuminated by lights and advertisements, slowly streaming into the stadium. They confirmed their seats, looked around, and were greeted with banners, flags, and airborne malt foam.

At the end, its full form was revealed — It was a grand palace, a heavenly wonder beyond even the combined skill of all of Insumousu's greatest artisans. It descended slowly, as if it had condensed from the heavens themselves. Insumousu's ocean was vast, but could it truly contain this celestial palace fallen from the skies? No one knew for certain.\\n\\n\"Amidst the chaos, some dispersed and fled in all directions. Others remained in the villages on land and under the sea, anticipating the descent of the Divine Fall.\"\\n\\nThe fallen Xianzhou Daiyu crashed onto the surface of Thalassa, leaving a deep watery crater in the heart of the Insumousu sea. For seven planetary days, the world trembled, while the magnificent ruins stood silently on the sea bed like the tragic and magnificent remains of a god. The survivors of Insumousu, living in their abodes in the sea bed, witnessed how their beloved homes were shattered by the celestial palace from beyond. Yet, with joy and elation, they soon found a new home in the remnants of the Daiyu after the Divine Fall.\\n\\nAs living conditions improved, the people of Insumousu had more time and energy to think. They finally had the opportunity to ask the most important questions as they gazed upon the magnificent ruins that descended from the heavens: Who were \"they\"? And from whence did \"they\" come?\\n\\nIn the days of old, the people of Insumousu knew not the art of metallurgy, nor had they yet invented written language. Thus, they turned to imagination to supplement their knowledge, and sought to understand all through the telling of stories. \"Legends\" were born as stories passed through the generations, turning into \"myths\" over time. \"Myths\" then shaped cognition as they themselves endure the flow of time — until \"civilization\" was born. As centuries passed and stars shifted in the sky, Thalassa became a trade partner of the Xianzhou Alliance. It was then that the aquatic people of Insumousu set foot inside the \"celestial palace\" for the first time. There, they beheld the complete grandeur of the Xianzhou, and at last learned the truth behind the Divine Fall.\\n\\nThe well-educated Insumousu gentry always regarded themselves as a continuation of the Daiyu. \"What the Daiyu once followed, we should follow. What the Daiyu once fought against, we should also fight.\" When they tell stories from the past, they would still begin with these words:\\n\\n\"Once upon a time, the palace of the gods fell from the heavens.\""

Insumousu's poets thus sing: \"The ocean may swallow mortals, yet their spirits live on forevermore.\"\\n\\nIn accordance with the calendar of Insumousu, the second day of rest in the Month of Tides is Divine Fall Day — when the water dwellers recite scriptures, consume herbs, and perform bizarre dances along the current in honor of the fallen \"gods\" who brought a blessing to Insumousu. In modern times, Divine Fall Day gradually lost its original religious meaning — songs replace scriptures, delicacies replace herbs, and only the peculiar dances remain to this day as a cultural heritage.\\n\\nIn the past few hundred Star Calendar years, Insumousu has been generous in sharing its unique culture with the outside world, and the form of Divine Fall Day has quietly undergone more changes.\\n\\nInsumousu's land cities are usually full of young people, prone to staying up all night singing and dancing during Divine Fall Day. Foreign visitors, especially Xianzhou tourists, often choose to join in the festivities. Foreigners frequently fall in love with the vibrant atmosphere of the cities, these places filled with fiery passion as unstoppable as tsunamis. As the water dwellers grow out of their adolescent years, their lungs would gradually shrink, their necks metamorphose into gills, and their hands, feet, and eyes become more suited for underwater life. The poets always say, \"The people of Insumousu give their noisy and boisterous youth to the land, and their quiet and solemn old age to the ocean.\"\\n\\nWith the support of Xianzhou's Celestial Guild, a new ritual was added to the Divine Fall Day celebration — People would dive into the wreckage of the Xianzhou Daiyu to search for the remains of Xianzhou humans, then inter them into starskiffs and launch the skiffs into the star of the Thalassa system.\\n\\nThrough their discovery of the history of the Daiyu, the people of Insumousu also learned of the tragedy behind its fall. When the Xianzhou Daiyu was irreparably damaged and breaking apart, Qingzhu, leader of the Daiyu, made the courageous decision to sacrifice herself and the entire ship to end the curse of the immortality plague. The Xianzhou Alliance hopes that the fallen heroes will receive a dignified soul-soothing ceremony and the people of Insumousu, who were spared from the disaster, have given their response.\\n\\nAt some point during the night of Divine Fall Day, the revelry would come to an abrupt halt. Adolescents, children, and Xianzhou residents would sit by the shore as adults emerge from the water and solemnly gaze at the oceanic horizon. Then, several starskiffs break through the water and fly from the bottom of the sea toward the star.\\n\\nThe starskiffs are each inscribed with a row of beautiful Insumousu calligraphy that reads, \"You should undo the ropes for drowned sailors. Don't cry. You can sail safely after my demise.\""

Glamoth's armies fought and failed, again and again... Colonies were scattered, and the proud iron fleet fell one after another. Besieged by the monsters with compound eyes and sheathed wings, the cries of the people of Glamoth were drowned out by despair, and the Welkin Empire was shattered from then on.\\n\\nUntil one day knights clad in mechanical armor descended from the sky and wiped out the sun-swallowing Swarm. Since then, the silver-white iron knights have traveled to and from the various star systems in the empire, crossing the devastated territories and fighting back against the calamity that wiped out the galaxy. They were like warriors born to fight the Swarm.

Under the Empress' command, Glamoth's Iron Cavalry charged across the skies, finally stemming the tide of enemies and bringing a moment of respite to the empire.\\n\\nBut in the never-ending battle against their archenemy, the empire started becoming more and more like its adversary — more and more Iron Cavalry flew high into the sky, blotting out the heavens just as the Swarm did on that fateful day. The look people cast on the Empress and the cavalry turned to one of fear, a fear akin to what they felt toward the Swarm. Perhaps one day the empire would attain the victory it so desired. But on that day, will Glamoth still be a paradise for humanity to rest in?\\n\\nThe Iron Cavalry Regiment formed the last line of defense at the border of Glamoth, where the battle raged on endlessly.

Opening a window no longer show a view of the stars in the deep sky, but of the city's shifting streams of light and shadows, holding up the constant echoes of giant clocks and theaters. The guests finally realize that they were never awake, but are instead witnessing Penacony's true nature in a dream — a place where time stops in a neverending dreamscape.\\n\\nEveryone knows that, under the rule of \"The Family,\" the doors of Penacony are open to everyone amidst the stars.

The velvety splendor of today's Penacony was born of salty rust, heavy shackles, and deprived freedom. The Planet of Festivities was once an IPC prison, where countless inmates were relocated to salvage the overflowing Memory Bubbles for the Garden of Recollection. People repeated their endless toils until their bodies were as heavy as lead, but their souls became as light as bubbles. At some unknown point in time, the small cells cut off access to reality, but people's consciousnesses became linked in dreams. In the midnight bell, that shared dream seemed so real, reflecting the sheer hypocrisy of reality.\\n\\nIt lasted until the Destruction melted the chains of the IPC, the Trailblaze connected this frontier to the other stars, and the Harmony arrived upon invitation to sow the seeds of peace. Freedom finally broke ground and added a new name to the original dream — Penacony.\\n\\nToday, there is no trace of the crumbling prison. In the dream world, a myriad of skyscrapers has been erected and the desert has been rebuilt and transformed into a metropolis — a new world for dreamers in search of wealth and opportunities, and a utopia for those in search of indulgence and pleasure. The past of the Planet of Festivities is like a photo that fell to the bottom of a cupboard — it exists, but is seen by no one.\\n\\nNowadays, the land of dreams is filled with songs of joy, and the noise of the past have been relegated to gossip, silently lost in the interlude of a comedy, in the behind-the-scenes of some cartoon, or in the side column of some magazine."

However, few remember that the Spheroids are actually imprisonment cages — the vehicle towards dreams are tools originally used for locking up prisoners.\\n\\nA long time ago, the IPC sent a huge number of prisoners to the Asdana star system in an attempt to stop a catastrophe from spreading.

The spherical work chambers in vacuum became an unforgettable \"memory\" for the prisoners — the hard curved interior walls, the awful experience of tumbling around, the unbearable daily attendance — perhaps these pains ran too deep. When those who regained their freedom pioneered the barren dreamscape, the spherical cages came along with them.\\n\\nBut now, unlike in the past, peace and freedom have given birth to optimism. Instead of trying to destroy the inescapable nightmares over and over, it is better to add to them the color this place should have, to take them in, and embrace them. So, the spherical imprisonment cages of the past have become today's Spheroids.\\n\\nIn the present, the fast-moving colorful Spheroids moving all over Penacony and the slight reverberations coming from within them... are all quietly hidden in the light of the dream city, blending in with the ambitions and laughter, like a land of dreams where time forever stands still."

			"When discussing Oswaldo Schneider, the head of the IPC's Marketing Development Department, people often focus on the decisive operations he undertook upon assuming the position. Within just two years, this young fanatic conquered the bitter cold, pestilence, and death, and managed to address three major longstanding issues that had plagued the Department for several Amber Eras. One of these challenges is the desolate planet known as Sigonia-IV, which is covered in barren deserts and scarred by clan vendettas... a place of harsh conditions and strife.\\n\\nSituated near the convergence of three major star clusters, Sigonia-IV has long been subjected to stellar winds from multiple stars, earning its reputation as the \"eye of the storm\" throughout the Cosmos. The planet's surface environment is extremely harsh, leading many civilizations to either migrate to other celestial bodies or succumb to natural disasters. Now, only a small number of intelligent races remain there, referred to as Sigonians by scholars from the Intelligentsia Guild.\\n\\nIn reality, Sigonians have fragmented into numerous clans, with most adopting nomadic lifestyles, while a few have established centralized systems of governance of reasonable size.\\n\\nThey share a common language. Through the translation provided by the Synesthesia Beacon, you will learn that \"Katica\" means \"shellslasher,\" who have a reputation of being the most ferocious clan among Sigonians. And \"Avgin\" means \"honey,\" who are often accused of pilfering by those willfully ignorant. These clans share a vendetta that lasted through Amber Eras, engaged in a cycle of bloody vengeance in the boundless wilderness where only the fittest survive — until mysterious figures clad in black descended from the sky. From there, Sigonians were briefly united under the radiance of Amber, and the natural cycles that were finally reached a temporary conclusion.\\n\\nAfterward, under the IPC's guidance, the Sigonians established the Sigonian Sovereignty according to the Interstellar Peace Charter and took their first steps toward the wider Cosmos.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this unity and progress did not extend to the Avgins and Katicans. Some malicious opportunists among the Sigonians viewed the former's resourcefulness with suspicion, while slandering the latter as nothing more than predators with no hope of enlightenment. Although they possessed only limited knowledge about Preservation, they understood that some of them had to be sacrificed for it. Utilizing a highly advanced set of parliamentary rules, these devious and corrupt individuals banished both clans to the endless desert.\\n\\nAs a token of apology, they even went out of their way to declare that \"the Avgins shall forever retain the right to autonomy\" — In other words, should any future conflicts occur between the two clans, they could justifiably and lawfully sit back and do nothing."

It's a conventional term irretrievably lost in the long arc of cosmic history.\\n\\nThe Avgins are blessed with attractive facial features, beautiful eyes, and an innate wealth of emotional intelligence, all of which effortlessly endear themselves to any strangers. However, these inborn talents are the exact reason they draw jealousy and ire from others. And the envious and snobbish soon begin their ceaseless slander, and the baseless defamation of the Avgins thus spreads like wildfire throughout the cosmos. As mere rumors can suffice to tarnish the sanctity of truth, the Avgins, a people of a peripheral world, found themselves assailed without recourse, subject to all manners of suspicion and prejudice.\\n\\nThe Avgins have an appreciation for intricately patterned fabrics, as well as a penchant for jewelry crafted from precious gemstones. They're particularly fond of turquoise meteorites, the only kind of gemstones capable of rivaling the resplendence of Gaiathra Triclops' divine body, which in their mythology is believed to have been reborn from death.\\n\\nKnown as Fenge Biyos, their Mother Goddess reigns over all matters related to fertility, travels, and trickery. Depictions of the Mother Goddess in the Avgins' religion often portray her as a left palm adorned with three eyes. The Avgins primarily express reverence for her through spoken prayers alone, believing that the Mother Goddess is as silent and unassuming as the mountains of Sigonia, and that crafting statues or composing hymns for her would only distance themselves from her protective embrace.\\n\\nThe Avgins view the world through the body of the Mother Goddess — the earth, the mountains, and all that exists on the land are a part of the Mother Goddess' divine body. And at the end of each calendar year, her divine body will perish.\\n\\nOn that significant day, her divine essence ascends as a resplendent aurora in the night sky and is reborn in the following day. Hence, Avgins celebrate the first day of the new year through their grand festival called \"Kakava.\" During this festival, they weave sacrificial vessels known as \"Knots of Cyclicality\" and toss them into bonfires to commemorate the Great Goddess' birth.\\n\\nAccording to the incident report by the Marketing Development Department, that shocking conflict took place on a night of Kakava. It was a stormy night when the clouds and fog engulfed the northern lights, which should have been seen as an ill omen. However, the Avgin people were unexpectedly excited. When questioned about this, a maiden from the clan provided the following response.\\n\\n\"Rain is a gift from the Mother Goddess. SHE is calling to us, urging us to take up arms and fight for our future.\"\\n\"This rain accompanies us. This rain protects us. It is in this rain that we shall meet our honorable demise.\""

Those who looked down named the land below \"Izumo.\" Those who looked up named the world above \"Takamagahara.\" One day uninscribed in the annals, the Yaoyorozu no Kami descended from Takamagahara. These demonic beasts named Kami overturned the skies, burned the rivers and oceans, and shattered the land — People realized in horror that it was not an invasion for rulership, dominance, or plunder. The evil Kami came only to kill.\\n\\nAs the planet stood on the brink of death, Izumo embarked on a Kami-slaying journey, exhausting the might of the entire country to slay the calamity named \"Sovereign of Revelation\" and forging the very first Edict Edge using its bestial body. Giving the Kami a taste of their own medicine, the wielder of these swords can recite the mantra contained within the blade to master the divine power of Takamagahara, and use it to combat the evil Kami and save the masses. From then on, Izumo started its long and arduous crusade, exchanging inordinate lives lost for the fall of one Kami after another, shattering countless mortal blades to forge the twelve Sentinels.\\n\\nIn the merciless fight for survival, Izumo used the might of the Edict Edges to light up their uncivilized world of darkness in less than ten Amber Eras, building cities of dazzling neon lights. That distant Takama Divine Realm, once so far away, became so close within their reach — Yet history suddenly stopped there. The existence of the two planets instantly evaporated, disappearing into nothingness.\\n\\nNowadays, the past of the border planet Izumo can only be gleaned from the scattered whispers in the universe. Academics hold various views regarding its disappearance, but none can solve the mystery. Izumo's history should have been a long flowing river, but it was severed in one cut, and all its past and future voided on emptiness' other shore. Did it never exist, and was it no more than a fabricated story? Did its histories never occur, and it ran aground on the beach of reverse causation? Was it yet another appalling experiment by Dr. Primitive, or was it a sign of the Voracity returning from the end of the Cosmos?\\n\\nOnly that pitch-black great sun knows the answer, yet THEY remain silent, never speaking.\\n\\nBecause everything that had happened will one day regress to the end, and everything that had ended is guaranteed to happen again.

			"The beginning of ancient foxian and borisin ballads all nostalgically sing of the \"Planet of Verdant\" and the planet's fertile soil and pleasant climate. However, upon closer inspection, the perceptive ones will realize such words are mere preludes to the eternal theme of \"war.\"\\nWith their talents for agriculture and commerce, some fox clans built prosperous towns next to flowing rivers. Meanwhile, the children of wolves roamed with their herd under the aurora-covered sky within the lush grasslands, forming settlements that dotted the landscape. The merchants laughed at the herders for the latter's savagery, while the herders despised the merchants for their deception. However, they both must confront the cruel torments of nature — the \"Vulpesummer\" and \"Lupuswinter.\"\\nIn the summer of rich harvests blessed by the fox deity, the two clans put down their arms and ceased warfare in mutual satisfaction. But once the wolf deity lets fall the white frost, the snowlines would spread from the poles and hunger shall drive the two clans to unceasing conflict.\\nThe ballads mention that the Lupuswinter once stayed far beyond its due, even after the sun of the old verdant home had circled the planet thirty-three times. Poverty and hunger crashed the people, and they resorted to even eating animals they once worshipped as totems. After foreseeing the end where the entire world shall be covered in bleak death, a savior climbed to the peak of the tallest mountain in that world — The foxian legends called this lady Tushan, but the borisin sagas called this man Duran. No matter what this savior was called, they made a wish to the Master of Immortality, hoping for sustenance enough to keep the world's people alive. Then, the mountains split, and sweet divine nectar of Redspring poured out from the hilly ravines.\\nThose who drank from the Redspring obtained power, dexterity, and strength from the beast meat they devoured. Their blood, too, stirred with the ferocity of animals, and their bodily forms became increasingly bestial — Thus was this world changed, never to return to its former days.\\nWith the Redspring as the medium, everything that the reborn canine races needed was made from this miraculous source — The fields no longer grew grain but viscorpi instead, and the garments that covered people's bodies were no longer of linen but of embryonic flesh. Even the chilly snowlands that once terrified the old verdant home civilizations were no longer a concern, for the canine races cultivated biological membranes in the polar regions to craft into warm dome-shaped tents, blocking the impoverished Lupuswinter beyond this barrier.\\nThen, things changed in the Planet of Verdant, just like how things changed for every short-life species that became long-life — There was a population explosion, ecological collapse, internal warfare... And no matter how hard the canine races prayed to the Master of Immortality, they never heard another reply. Then, the people understood the truth: Everything that the Master of Immortality could give has been given, and if the people wish to have better lives, they must take it themselves.\\nGathered around Duran the great Brood Lord, the canine races cast their sight into the sky where the Master of Immortality dwelled. The stars sparkled like a grassland waiting to be conquered with fast steads, and they will bring the \"Lupuswinter\" to the civilizations on those planets.\\nMuch later, their sworn enemies gave them the name \"borisin,\" for \"boris\" meant \"wolf\" in the language of the Planet of Verdant."

This pristine bridle would become a book that recorded the history of their battles throughout their lives.\\nAs soon as the adulthood ceremony ended, the borisin youths must walk into the weapon farm, then pick and tame their first battle mount among the \"mechabeasts\" that had been filtered and bred via gene witchcraft. Mechabeasts that consumed the conquered as their feed had astounding agility, perception, and ferocity — Yet they were considered mere sheep when faced against their future masters. As the moonlight stirred the violent blood in their veins, the borisin youths chased and dueled against the mechabeasts. Some would die from the beast's kiss — That would be the result of cowardice. Some would kill their peers — That was the law of how valiant beasts shall be distributed... The borisin youths tripped the desired mount to the ground and tied the bridle, inlaid with neural spike whips, onto the animal's neck — The beast would be stunned through telepathy with its future master and became as tame as they have received hundreds of whiplashes. When the beast willingly carried the master on its back, a fitting borisin sorya (warrior, rider) would have been born.\\nThen, the borisin bridle would become the recorder of wars, and the reins would gradually become full of scratches, knots, and accessories.\\nThe well-trained sorya would don jellyfish-like membranous armor under the leadership of a yonda (leader, centurion). They would then board the beast ships that can warp between stars, explore different worlds, and swear to make the stars into their herding ground in the name of Duran and the Master of Immortality. On the bridle, light scratches indicated how many enemies the owner had slain, knots recorded how many major campaigns they were involved in, and the accessories dangling from the reins were loot such as human teeth and Intellitron cores obtained from pillaging frenzies... They were the vengeance and wails of the conquered, as well as medals for borisin individuals to demonstrate their strength.\\nWhen the mounts beneath the warrior perished in warfare, or when borisin wished to mete out punishment, the bridle would also be fastened around the face of other living beings.\\nTheir targets were usually foxians — The slave race excluded from the clan due to genetic selection plans. They were weak, devious, and were only fit for lowly labor and calculations. Whenever rare war-like individuals emerged among the foxians, the master of the wolf-head would prioritize binding these foxians with the bridles, driving them as war slaves to serve as vanguards on the battlefield.\\nIf all slaves had died, and the weapons were bent, then the bridle could still act as a whip if one attached a spike to the end. If the bridle was snapped and the warrior perished in war with their fangs and claws shattered, then the bridle would become the sole remaining epitaph and memories for borisin...\\nJust as the old tales said that \"the position between the predator and prey often changes in the forest,\" countless wolf-kind bridles have broken and snapped after fighting for millennia against the Xianzhou in this dark forest called the universe. At the end, this link that connected various clans was severed by the sharp arrow of The Hunt, and borisin also fell into the shadow of internal strife and general decay, becoming ever more removed from their former pride."

			"The Xianzhou Zhuming had floated in the starry seas for over eight millennia after setting sail from the Primeval Imperium. If one were able to view a chronological snapshot of how the starship's form had changed, it would be a very romantic experience — The colossal ship swallowed a deep-blue star, peeled off the worn hull layer by layer, swelled as a brimming bud, and finally bloomed into a lotus.\\nFrom space, the entire Xianzhou Zhuming appears as a lotus lantern of filigree gold. The giant glowing \"lotus leaves\" gradually spread out around the \"light poles\" and are bathed in a soft blue glow, being indeed worthy of poems that declare it \"A ship whose hull deceives the eyes, a lotus whose petals like candles glow.\" The \"lampstand\" section at the center of the ship is a spherical cage, its size on the magnitude of a celestial object. It tightly wraps around the azure sun, the \"lantern wick,\" and eternally spins. This mega structure is the most important location for the Xianzhou Zhuming's manufacturing industry — the Flamewheel Forge.\\nIn the past, the Zhuming Grand Artisan Yang Di had received a weapon mold from the anonymous sovereign of the Primeval Imperium as a gift when the fleet set off on their voyage. Thousands of years later, though the fleet has now changed beyond recognition with their immortality and the return voyage will never occur, the tradition of the Grand Artisan never died. In the Xianzhou Zhuming, artisanship is the supreme school of learning. All its generals also held the title of the Artisanship Commission's Furnace Master. When they left the ship, they commanded thousands of troops. When they returned to the ship, they would swing their hammer and forge wondrous items, and receive the people's supreme respect. More than half of the weapons used in the Xianzhou's hunts throughout the fleet's history were forged in the Xianzhou Zhuming. Therefore, the Flamewheel Forge came to be regarded as the holy pilgrimage site for such technologies in the entire Cosmos.\\nMetalsmithing is a measure of the advance of civilizations, while flames mark the beginning of civilizations. Many civilizations, while in their infancy, were most troubled with the problem of energy sources. The people spared no effort in discovering energy sources that would support their civilization to new heights. The Xianzhou Zhuming had stepped over this limitation — By imprisoning the progenitor of heliobi, the Flint Emperor, the artisans have obtained a literally inexhaustible power source. The Flamewheel Forge has intricate branch-like track systems that cover the star as much as possible, and the delicate boughs and leaves are choked with receptors and transmitters that guide the primal fire \"Flint Emperor\" to provide enough energy for all technological developments.\\nCountless artisans had regarded the Zhuming Artisanship Commission, which swallowed up a Pseudo Sun, as the hallowed halls of the craft. Apprentices who wanted to forge divine tools swarm the institution. With enough force, anything can be crafted, and the Flamewheel Forge has prepared everything the artisans could possibly need —\\nApprentices from different worlds come together in the Forge and become fellow students, then compete and share their skills. Outworlders who come in search of marvelous tools would also pay a hefty sum to entrust artisans into crafting otherworldly items — However, the countless apprentices over the millennia have rarely been favored by General Huaiyan, the \"Artisan of Artisans.\" Whenever he tutored students himself and personally passed on his skills both as a craftsman and a soldier, these students would either become grandmasters who left a mark in the annals as Furnace Masters or became Cloud Knights with names that thundered through the Alliance such as the Flamewheel Octet.\\n\"Forges wrought a million stars bright, irons craft heroes' soaring flight. Miniscule lights into martial might made, only with sharp blades are peace and plenty kept.\" From the day a Zhuming artisan received their tools, they must always remember — What they will spend their days and nights making are no simple weapons, but the arrows carrying the creed of The Hunt."

Then, the judges pass these harmless heliobi to the Artisanship Commission's Temperaflame Office, which matches the heliobi with various artifacts to make them into lamps, vehicles, and various spectacles in Zhuming... However, in the eyes of the confused outworlders, these talking and walking items are proof of the rumor that \"divine essence exists everywhere in the delves, and items would become demons once they are ancient enough\"...\\nFollowing the alien-colored light band, one can walk deeper past the Forge and arrive at the hypergravity field created by the Pseudo Sun. Mortals struggle to endure a stellar density of this degree. It is an inwardly collapsing disorder that only Disattva artisans can traverse with ease.\\nThe scorching stellar surges and abnormal celestial phenomena prevent the curious from continuing on to approach the Pseudo Sun. All fundamental physical laws of the universe in this space have been augmented to a terrifying degree. Only one stout and powerful stellar race, the Disatta, can survive in a space with such gravitational abnormalities — Disatta are natural-born elite artisans. They pass between the Forge and the Pseudo Sun, and their perception of time has long strayed from that of normal beings. They still keep their promise and continue to improve their artisanship, forging the ship's enormous cannons and keeping watch over the Pseudo Sun's slumber. The Xianzhou Zhuming regard Disatta as loyal allies, respecting their tenacity and strength, while being grateful for their selfless sacrifice.\\nAnd yet, no being can follow the light bands further across the outlandish and twisted gravity field to reach deep into the Pseudo Sun. That is a forbidden place to all beings capable of emotion, a room where the endless dream of the Flint Emperor floats — The Xianzhou Zhuming is always on watch, for even the smallest sliver of emotional disturbances can awaken the boundless might of the heliobi progenitor.\\nThere are frequently individuals who ignore the warning and cast their gaze upon the Pseudo Sun from afar. They would unknowingly slip into the psychological gravitational field, and their smallest carelessness would result in their sentience being taken away by the torrential mirages that pour out like a tide. Different from interacting with the gentle illusions, staring upon that \"azure sun\" would only make one feel the boundless rage that has been suppressed since the beginning of time — \"The heliobi shall give the heroes power to scorch the very heavens, but when all duties have been fulfilled, the heroes must give to the heliobi supreme bodies forged into perfection...\" No one knows how this ancient oath could be fulfilled. Similarly, none knows when the Flint Emperor would awaken from its bottomless dream.\\nDeep within the lotus lantern's wick, the Pseudo Sun heaves a profound sigh in its unending sleep. The ship slowly sails across the sky, leaving behind only an iridescent trail. Just like this, the Xianzhou Zhuming will continue to ally with fire, travel with fire, and share its destiny with fire."

Before pulling out her gun, she had remained upright like a mountain rock that had not been moved in centuries. She finished all her preparations before the bandits could even move a finger. After a round of clear-sounding shots, Oakley intentionally let go of one bandit to send out a warning to the whole cohort.\\n\\nThoughtless, expressionless, often leaving her opponents with no hope of ever defeating her — that was how her fellow bounty hunters viewed Oakley.\\n\\nWhile dueling, Oakley was more like that one mysterious intruding gunslinger in her dreams, with her brisk and clean shots and not a single superfluous move. She couldn't help but resent her own self when she realized that she was becoming more and more like her nemesis."

No one but tarantulas, sandstorms, and tumbleweeds. Through her journey, Oakley was becoming better at coming up with techniques to kill time.

The IPC offered bounty hunters plenty of opportunities for interstellar traveling, and the destination was never a concern for this particular lone musketeer.\\n\\nSometimes Oakley did wonder if she was just chasing a phantom all this time, since that mysterious gunslinger was long gone without a trace. Sometimes it seemed that all Oakley ever did was to set out for one mission after another.\\n\\nOakley insisted, however, that as long as her fame as the Wild Wheat was far-reaching enough, the mysterious gunslinger would eventually show up at her door, just like how he once did at the ranch to duel her father."

Auch nach der starken Vereinfachung erlauben die Beinschienen es dem Träger, wie eine Rakete loszudüsen – wie, das wissen Ingenieure bis heute nicht genau.\\n\\nLaut den Ingenieuren wurde die Rüstung im Limbo zwischen Traum und Realität konzipiert.

Sie wachte immer mit einem Schreck auf, kurz bevor sie das Gesicht deutlich erkennen konnte. Benommen berührte sie ihre Augenprothese, die ihr so viel Schmerz bereitet hatte. Mit Hilfe der falschen Augen musste sie die verschwommene Gestalt nicht mehr durch Geräusche, Gerüche und Berührungen zusammensetzen.\\n\\n„Es ist nicht mehr von Nutzen“, sagte der Emanator des Schöpfers des Ruins. Sie hörte das Geräusch des schwingenden Handfächers und das schallende Lachen des Emanators. „Bald wirst du alles sehen können, was du sehen willst – mit deinen eigenen Augen.“\\n\\n„Das sind meine eigenen Augen“, sagte sie lächelnd, „und ich werde nie wieder die Gelegenheit haben, die Szenerie zu sehen, die sie einmal gesehen haben.“"

Es gibt sogar Geschichten, in welchen er einhundert Fuß hoher Riese von ist. Doch alle Geschichten haben eines gemeinsam: der Uhrmacher trägt stets ein prächtiges Kostüm.\\n\\nEine der Geschichten besagt, dass der Uhrmacher seine Geheimnisse mit seinen Tanzgefährten teile, wenn die Nacht und die Morgendämmerung miteinander verschmelzen. Als die Menschen dies hörten, gingen sie zum Kostümball und baten jeden prachtvoll gekleideten geheimnisvollen Gast zum Tanz. Immer mehr Traumgäste lernten sich durch diesen Ball kennen, und so wurde er allmählich zu einem Ort, an dem Freundschaften und Romanzen geschlossen wurden. Die teuren Eintrittstickets verkaufen sich wie von selbst. Selbst wenn der legendäre Uhrmacher nie auftaucht, wird dies die Leidenschaft der Gäste, neue Bekanntschaften zu machen, nicht behindern.\\n\\n„Deiner Kleidung nach zu urteilen könntest du der berühmte Uhrmacher sein?“ Diese Worte, ursprünglich eine aufrichtige Frage, wurden schließlich zu einer Floskel für die Einladung zum Tanz.\\n\\nSo hat der Uhrmacher mit dem Kostümball ein weiteres Geschäft gegründet und nebenbei der Traumlandschaft ein Flair der Romantik und Leidenschaft verliehen."

			"Früher hatte Frau Herta mit dem Problem zu kämpfen, dass ihre enorme Sammlung von Gegenständen über die ganze Galaxie verstreut war. Die unzähligen Gegenstände waren schwer zu lagern und Herta hatte absolut keine Lust, sich selbst um sie zu kümmern.\\n\\nSchließlich trat die überaus großzügige Interastrale Friedenskorporation mit einer Lösung an sie heran. So entstand die Herta-Raumstation als Hüterin des Wissens und der Geheimnisse. Man traf umfassende Sicherungsmaßnahmen, um die Raumstation von oben bis unten auf ihren gedachten Verwendungszweck vorzubereiten – die Gesamtheit der Dinge in einer umfassenden Sammlung zu vereinen, in der Ordnung und Klarheit herrschen. Phänomene wurden in speziellen Behältnissen aufbewahrt und die Sammlung von Kuriositäten in Verzeichnissen geordnet. Zahllose Gegenstände wurden kategorisiert und klassifiziert, dann zu Forschungszwecken tief ins Innere der Station gebracht.\\n\\nDie IFK schlug daraufhin vor, auf der Station jeden willkommen zu heißen, der das Geheimnis der Sterne ergründen will. So zog es neugierige und abenteuerlustige Wissenschaftler auf der Suche nach den Wundern des Universums auf die Raumstation.\\n\\nDie meisten von ihnen bewunderten Frau Herta und schworen, ihrem Streben nach der Erforschung jener Geheimnisse, die ihnen die Sterne zuflüsterten, stets treu zu bleiben. Sie erforschten die Sternensysteme und die Reiche der Lebewesen, führten Debatten über Ethik, Philosophie und die Frage nach wahrer Gerechtigkeit, erfassten die Sternenlandschaft der Galaxie, entzifferten die Geheimnisse, die sich um religiöse Rituale und Zeremonien rankten, und hielten stets an ihrem Grundsatz fest, in der Praxis nach Wahrheit zu suchen ... Ihr oberstes Gebot war der freie, offene Zugang zu Forschung, und sie setzten sich unentwegt dafür ein, dass das erlangte Wissen weitergegeben wurde.\\n\\nAls die Raumstation jedoch in die Umlaufbahn einschwenkte, begann sie selbstständig zu arbeiten, und Frau Herta ließ sich nur noch selten blicken. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt stellte die IFK fest, dass das Treiben auf der Station langsam im Sumpf der Banalität versunken war. Die Genialität der Forscher machte sich kaum noch bemerkbar.\\n\\nDas Licht, das aus den verschiedenen Zonen flutete, raubte den Bewohnern jegliches Zeitgefühl, und die Station verfiel allmählich in einen öden Alltagstrott, der von Teilnahmslosigkeit und Ennui geprägt war. Oft kam es dazu, dass ein paar Forscher stundenlange Diskussionen über ein gewisses Objekt aus der Sammlung führten, was manchmal in Streit ausartete. Ab und zu versäumte es ein Beamter des Sicherheitspersonals, seine täglichen Runden zu drehen, und wurde später bei einem Nickerchen in ihren kasernenartigen Bunkern entdeckt. Manchmal hielten es Forschungsleiter für angebracht, ihren jüngeren Kollegen zu erzählen, was sie aus ihren früheren Romanzen gelernt hatten. Es kam auch vor, dass sich irgendein hohes Tier als gewöhnliche Aushilfskraft verkleidete, um die Zeit bis zur nächsten glücklichen Fügung totzuschlagen ... Neben der Forschung gab es immer noch das Leben. Was die Aussicht von der Raumstation nur zu klar verdeutlichte – ein Meer aus Sternen, die sie auf ihrer Reise begleiteten.\\n\\nTrotz aller Einschränkungen schien für die Forscher dem Leben auf der Raumstation eine gewisse Romantik beizuwohnen – wenn Galaxie ein episches Gedicht war, so war die Herta-Raumstation wie eine Hand, die den Gedichtband langsam öffnete."

Die IFK hatte zwar Sicherheitspersonal zur Verfügung gestellt, und das automatische Verteidigungssystem war relativ fortgeschritten, aber trotzdem waren diese Maßnahmen schlichtweg unzureichend, um einem Angriff aus den Sternen vorzubeugen ... Frau Herta war sich sicher, dass ein solcher Fall eintreffen würde, also traf sie die Entscheidung, die Station an einen anderen Ort zu verlegen. So konnte sie den verschwörerischen Versuch, die Raumstation einzunehmen, schon im Voraus vereiteln.\\n\\nIhre Fähigkeit, Informationen zu sammeln und Krisen zu verhindern, beschrieb sie einfach so: „Während andere Bücher lesen, mache ich Kaffee.“\\n\\nDie Raumstation war vielen Gefahren ausgesetzt – Dieben, die es auf die wertvolle Sammlung abgesehen hatten, und mysteriösen Gruppen mit rätselhaften Beweggründen – aber die größte Bedrohung ging von Herta selbst aus. Sollte sie eine verrückte Idee haben, würde dies den Untergang der Raumstation bedeuten. Kuriositäten, die einen Sternenkollaps simulieren, ein verzerrtes Gravitationsfeld, das durch die Kollision dunkler Galaxien entsteht ... Solcherlei Dinge sammelte Frau Herta, wenn ihr danach zumute war, aber sobald sie diese in ihren Besitz gebracht hatte, verlor sie schnell das Interesse daran.\\n\\nZwar schien die Raumstation friedlich im Weltraum zu schweben, doch ihr Inhalt bedrohte sie wie ein Damoklesschwert.\\n\\nDie leitenden Wissenschaftler hatten sich schon lange daran gewöhnt, ständig derlei Gefahren ausgesetzt zu sein. Wie das Sprichwort sagt: „Geheimnisse verstecken sich tief in der Gefahr.“ Sie hielten sich streng an die geltenden Vertraulichkeitsvereinbarungen und die standardisierten Eindämmungsverfahren zur Sammlung und Sicherung, und schufen so ein Schweigen, unter dem die Gefahr begraben lag ... In der Cafeteria waren sie Freunde, die miteinander plauderten und Witze rissen. Tief im Innern der Lagerbereiche der Raumstation waren sie hochqualifizierte Experten. An diesem Ort würden Geheimnisse stets geheim bleiben.\\n\\nIm niedrigen Orbit um das Blau war auf der Raumstation alles wie immer.

Sie durchquerte auf der Suche nach dem Elixier der Unsterblichkeit und einer Audienz bei Gott die Tiefen des Weltraums.\\n\\nDas Ungetüm, das ganze Biosphären umfasste, trieb durch das Sternenmeer, als wäre es der klare helle Mond, der langsam in der Nacht versinkt und sich auf eine endlose und ungewisse Reise macht. Auf dieser langen Fahrt verfielen die Reisenden in tiefen Schlaf und erwachten schließlich, nur um dann wieder einzuschlafen, ein nicht enden wollender Wechsel der Bewusstseinszustände ... Wale auf der Jagd nach Sternen fielen vom Himmelsdom, und Kristallwesen aus Subkorngittern überspannten ohne Unterbrechung Lichtjahre. Die Elixiersucher wurden Zeuge von Kräften übernatürlicher Erhabenheit. In ihrem verstohlenen Entzücken waren sie entschlossener denn je, Unsterblichkeit zu erlangen.\\n\\nNach einer jahrtausendelangen Reise kam die Xianzhou Luofu langsam zum Stillstand. Hier traf sie im Limbo zwischen Realität und Imagination auf den Meister des Überflusses. Yaoshi schenkte dem Schiff ein göttliches Wunder und es manifestierte sich als der Himmelsbaum. Sein Schatten war so groß wie Wolken. Er verdeckte den Himmel und die Sonne. Seine Wurzeln waren dick und dicht und gingen durch das gesamte Xianzhou-Schiff – die Luofu war zum Leben erwacht.\\n\\nJene, die Unsterblichkeit begehrten, schluckten die Frucht des Himmelsbaumes und erlangten endlich die endlose Lebensdauer, von der sie geträumt hatten. Die Bewohner von Xianzhou, die sich als himmlische Wesen bezeichneten, genossen ihr ewiges Leben in vollen Zügen. Sie benutzten den Himmelsbaum, um mithilfe der Segnungen der Unsterblichkeit eine Vielzahl übermenschlicher Wunder zu schaffen.\\n\\nDoch genau wie der Wechsel von Sonne und Mond war das, was einst gedieh, dem Untergang geweiht, und was einst Freude brachte, musste schließlich Qualen verursachen. Erst mit der Ankunft der Ära der drei Leiden, in der das Volk von Xianzhou durch Qual und Peinigung an den Rand des Untergangs getrieben wurde, lernten sie die Wahrheit, dass im Herzen des Wunders nur unerträgliches Unheil wartete.\\n\\nDoch inmitten der Katastrophe erhob sich ein Held als der Herrscherbogen und spaltete den Himmelsbaum entzwei. Das Volk von Xianzhou erlangte seine Menschlichkeit zurück und schwor sodann, an der Sterblichkeit festzuhalten und dem unsterblichen Untergang in diesem Universum ein Ende zu setzen. In den folgenden Jahren begann Xianzhou, in den Sternenmeeren auf die Jagd zu gehen, um die Ausgeburten des Todes zu beseitigen. Die Foxianer erlangten ihre Freiheit zurück und herrschten nun wieder über den Himmel, während die Vidyadhara die Verseuchung und anhaltenden Katastrophen eindämmten. Die drei Völker bildeten schließlich eine Koalition, und so schlug die Geburtsstunde der Xianzhou-Allianz.\\n\\nDie kommende Reise war in Zyklen von Wohlstand und Unglück geprägt. Helden und Legenden traten im Laufe der Geschichte immer wieder in Erscheinung. Endlich in einer Zeit des hart erkämpften Friedens erholt sich die Xianzhou Luofu und wird wieder aufgebaut. Der freie Handel und offene Geister hatten ihr neues Leben eingehaucht.\\n\\nUnsterblichkeit hat die Xianzhou Luofu zu dem gemacht, was sie heute ist. Durch Höhen und Tiefen hat sich das Schiff eine einzigartige Aura angeeignet, eine Mischung aus Antike und Moderne. Ein jeder reisende Händler würde binnen Sekunden verstehen, welche Spuren der Lauf der Zeit auf der Xianzhou Luofu hinterlassen hat."

			"Der Meister des Überflusses pflanzte den Samen des Karmas in das Herz der Xianzhou Luofu, und schenkte den Elixiersuchern etwas, das sie den „Himmelsbaum“ nannten. Es wurde als ein Wunder angesehen, da die Menschen sofort in der Lage waren, seine Bedeutung zu verstehen.\\n\\nDer Himmelsbaum trug Früchte der Göttlichkeit, voller Leben und Vitalität, denen die endlose Lebensdauer innewohnte, nach der die Elixiersucher so sehnlich gesucht hatten. Von diesem Moment an verloren die alten Tabus und Gesetze jegliche Bedeutung. Der Machtspruch der Natur und die Ethik, das mit dem Leben auch das Altern und der Tod einhergeht, gehörte nun der Vergangenheit an. Die Leute benutzten den Weg der Unsterblichkeit, um den Himmelsbaum immer intensiver zu nutzen. So schufen sie Land, das nie unfruchtbar wurde, formten ihre eigenen Körper, um ihre Gestalt zu verändern, und gaben den Tieren die Gabe des Denkens und Sprechens ... Unter den Ästen des Himmelsbaumes kam es zu unzählbaren technischen Errungenschaften, die über jegliche Vorstellungskraft hinausgingen.\\n\\nDoch mit der Zeit zeigten sich Risse in der Maske des Himmelsbaumes, und allmählich trat sein abscheuliches Gesicht zutage. Die Unsterblichen erfuhren nun die Pein der Unsterblichkeit.\\n\\nDie Himmlischen hatten sich unentwegt fortgepflanzt, kannten aber keinen Tod. So kam es auf dem Schiff bald zur Überbevölkerung, und das Volk von Xianzhou fand sich im Griff der Hungersnot. Die Jungen in Xianzhou erhielten nie die Möglichkeit, ihr Potenzial zu entfalten, während die Älteren sich an der Macht festklammerten. Die Gesellschaftsordnung war im Begriff, zusammenzubrechen ... Aufstände der Aurumatonen und Invasionen von außen prägten ein Jahrtausend des Verfalls. Erst danach bemerkte man, welche Dunkelheit im Blut der Unsterblichkeit eigentlich versteckt lag. Der sogenannte „Körper der Himmlischen“ war einfach eine Technologie, die den menschlichen Intellekt übertraf. Die Tendenz, von Mara befallen zu werden, war für das Volk von Xianzhou eine Warnung, dass sie nur einen Schritt davon entfernt waren, selbst zu Ausgeburten zu werden.\\n\\nInmitten dieser Verzweiflung spaltete ein Held durch einen mächtigen Schuss mit seinem Bogen den Himmel – und mit ihm den Himmelsbaum. Doch obwohl jetzt nur noch ein verbrannter Baumstumpf von ihm übrig blieb, war das Schicksal der Xianzhou bis in alle Ewigkeit mit dem des Himmelsbaumes verknüpft.\\n\\nEr war es, der ferne Mächte anzog, die in Xianzhou einfielen. Die Ausgeburten des Überflusses starteten eine Vielzahl von Angriffen, bei denen Fleisch entstellt und Blut vergossen wurde, nur um Xianzhou vollständig zu verschlingen. Der Baum verführte auch die Bewohner von Xianzhou. Die Jünger des Sanctus Medicus brachen die Tabus, um die Geheimnisse des Überflusses zu ergründen, die in den Tiefen des Himmelsbaumes schlummerten, und das einst mächtige Imperium der Unsterblichen zurückzubringen ... In den langen Tagen der externen und internen Unruhe lauerte der verbleibende Korpus des Himmelsbaumes stets im Hintergrund. Er war wie die endlosen Ranken, die in den Schatten wuchsen, und nur auf eine Gelegenheit warteten, um wieder Unheil anzurichten.\\n\\nGlücklicherweise behielt die Xianzhou Luofu den sterbenden Baum stets im Auge und wurde niemals unachtsam. Die Menschen hatten geschworen, diese Quelle der Ausgeburten in das Ende aller Dinge stürzen zu lassen."

Mit der Kraft der Bewahrung lenkt das Unterstützungsteam die Flotte in verschiedene Galaxien, um Baumaterialien wie Stein, Holz, Gold und Supernium zu kaufen. Unermüdlich wird Baumaterial zur Subraumbarriere geliefert und in der planetaren Ödnis angehäuft.\\n\\nNach einer kurzen Erschließungsphase konnte das Unterstützungsteam sich in Pier Point niederlassen und gründete dort die Interastrale Friedenskorporation. Um ihre Aufgabe voll und ganz erfüllen zu können, richtete die Korporation ihren Blick in die Tiefen des Alls.\\n\\nAuf Louis Flemings Aufforderung hin verließ die Handelsflotte die angrenzenden Sternensysteme des Äons Qlipoth. Zu ihrem Sortiment gehörten nun nicht mehr nur Baumaterialien ... Ihr Plan lautete nun, die Galaxie zu vernetzen und mit allem zu handeln. Bald darauf erließ Dongfang Qixing galaxieweite Handelsbestimmungen und errichtete ein „Credit“-System als Standard für den Handel im Universum. In die Billionen gehende Warenbestände sammelten sich unter der Megastruktur von Pier Point wie in einem Schwarzen Loch und ließen sämtliche Vorstellungen von den Grenzen des Reichtums lächerlich erscheinen.\\n\\nHeute sind die Schiffe der Interastralen Friedenskorporation überall in der Galaxie anzutreffen. Obgleich sie bereits als Konzerndiktatur kritisiert wird, expandiert die IFK immer weiter. Für sie spielt die Meinung anderer keine Rolle und sie folgt stets der Mission, mit der sie gegründet wurde.\\n\\nDie Methoden im Rekrutentraining der IFK sind stetigen Veränderungen unterworfen. Nur eine Tradition wurde in den fast <unbreak>800</unbreak> Bernsteinzeitaltern immer beibehalten. Damals stand Louis Fleming, der Gründer der IFK vor dem Unterstützungsteam und hielt eine leidenschaftliche Rede. Er setzte sich dafür ein, das Universum zu vereinen und es entsprechend den Wünschen des Äons zu schützen. Sobald die Rede endete, erklang in der Ferne das gewaltige Geräusch eines galaktischen Aufpralls und verlieh diesem feierlichen und erhabenen Moment eine höhere Bedeutung. Von diesem Moment an wurde allen klar, dass sie einem unerschütterlichen Glauben folgten.\\n\\n„Alles im Namen des Bernsteinfürsten.“"

Das Unterstützungsteam belud eine ausreichend große Flotte mit seltenen und wertvollen Waren und konnte mit ihrem überzeugenden Angebot überall im Sternensystem unzählige Geschäfte abschließen. Daraufhin hatte das Unterstützungsteam Handelsrouten und -informationen fest im Griff und besaß exklusive Verhandlungsrechte, wodurch es die Handelsbestimmungen der Galaxie entscheidend prägen konnte.\\n\\nFlotten voller Holz, Stein, Stahl und Supernium flogen an Äon Qlipoth vorbei wie ein Schwarm kreisender Fliegen.

Die IFK hatte alles im Angebot, was sich ein Planet nur wünschen konnte, und das zu fairen Preisen, die an ihre „Credits“ gebunden waren. Damals entstand die Handelsroute der Galaxie. Alle Planeten, die sich dem Handelsnetz der IFK anschließen, können die gleiche Währung nutzen, die gleichen Waren kaufen und die gleichen Services erhalten.\\n\\nHandelsschiffe des Credit-Systems reisten zwischen den Sternen und aus den sich bündelnden und aufspaltenden Handelsrouten formte sich ein galaxieübergreifendes Netz. Schiffe voller Schätze von fernen Sternen passierten den Äon Qlipoth unzählige Male wie Glühwürmchen, und der Äon blieb still wie zuvor.\\n\\nDie seit der Zeit des Unterstützungsteams angesammelten Baumaterialien häuften sich auf jedem Planeten rund um den Äon Qlipoth, und ihre Menge wächst stetig weiter. Der Äon Qlipoth hat nicht die Absicht, diese eifrig dargebrachten Geschenke anzunehmen. Stattdessen konzentriert er sich allein auf die Gefahr, die den nichts ahnenden Sterblichen droht, und muss gigantische Barrieren errichten, die sich nur in Lichtjahren messen lassen. Aus der kleinen Organisation, die einst Materialien einkaufte, ist schon lange eine Großmacht der Galaxie geworden. Ihre Angehörigen blickten auf den kopflosen Koloss, ohne ihre Mühen je für vergeblich zu halten.\\n\\n„Alle Mühen und alles Mehren unseres Kapitals dienen Qlipoth, auf dass wir den Willen des Äons vollbringen, wenn die Zeit kommt.“"

			"Was den Ursprung mechanischen Lebens angeht, haben die kohlenstoffbasierten Gelehrten der Intelligenzia-Gilde eine einzigartige Theorie: Sie vermuten dahinter ein zufällig entstandenes Elektronengebilde.\\n\\nElektrischer Strom fließt durch Atmosphäre und Boden. Er wird durch die ständig wiederholte Einwirkung von Gravitations- und Abstoßungskräften in Sekundärformen unterschiedlicher Stärke unterteilt. Laut der Hypothese der Gelehrten ist dieser Vorgang das Äquivalent zur Zellteilung bei kohlenstoffbasierten Lebensformen. Daraufhin geben Ströme über die natürliche Transistorstruktur auf der Planetenoberfläche zufällig verschiedene Spannungen ab und lassen so ein primitives Programm ablaufen. Die stolzen Gelehrten erklärten, auf diese Weise hätten Maschinen „Gedanken“, die mit denen kohlenstoffbasierter Lebensformen vergleichbar seien.\\n\\nEin Mechaniker erhob Einspruch: Wie können kohlenstoffbasierte Lebensformen, die noch nicht mal den Ursprung ihrer eigenen Existenz verstehen, die Dreistigkeit besitzen, solchen Humbug von sich zu geben? Als diese Worte erklangen, erschütterten sie die akademische Welt des Universums in ihren Grundfesten. Das mechanische Leben begann, den überheblichen „Kohlenstoffzentrismus“ infrage zu stellen und seine eigene Herkunft zu erforschen.\\n\\nAllerdings blieb den Screwllumiten nichts anderes übrig, als ihren Vorstoß auszusetzen. Die Energie ihres Planeten schwand schneller, als ihre Inspirationsschaltkreise arbeiteten. Erst einmal mussten sie einen Weg finden, ihr Überleben zu sichern.\\n\\nSchließlich fassten sie einen radikalen Plan, der mehrere Bernsteinzeitalter umspannte: Sie benutzten den sterbenden Planeten als Energiequelle für den Himmlischen Differenziator. Der gewaltige Apparat verarbeitete unablässig Lochstreifen und wiederholte systematisch Kalkulationen. Mithilfe ihrer planetaren Energieversorgung simulierte die riesige Maschine ein stabiles Superökosystem. Rund um den Mutterstern errichteten die Screwllumiten dann ihr neue Heimat.\\n\\nNachdem sie die Katastrophe auf ihrem Planeten bewältigt hatten, fanden die Screwllumiten etwas Ruhe. In ihrer stets rationalen, optimistischen und eleganten Art sind sie entschlossen, der Frage nach ihrem Ursprung auf den Grund zu gehen.\\n\\nDas gigantische System ist erfüllt vom Klang mahlender Zahnräder, die den Lochstreifen ständig weitertransportieren, um ihm Daten zu entlocken. Eine Rechenbahn zweigt sich immer wieder auf in viele weitere, sodass die unzähligen Bahnen Milliarden von Zahnrädern dröhnen lassen ... Dann laufen diese Bahnen immer wieder und wieder zusammen und stürzen schließlich in den brodelnden Schmelzofen des Kerns, wo sie verstummen. Im Laufe vieler Jahre wurde das programmierte Superökosystem immer lebensfreundlicher und relativ stabil. Und irgendwann inspirierten die Mutmaßungen über die Herkunft der Maschinen die Fantasie der Screwllumiten.\\n\\nDas stählerne Konstrukt, das den sterbenden Planeten umschließt, aktivierte einmal mehr ihre intelligenten Denkschaltkreise. So werden sie weiterhin über ihren Ursprung grübeln und forschen, bis die allgegenwärtige mechanische Sonne vollständig ausgebrannt ist."

Wer noch wach war, dem brachte sie einen Sonnenaufgang; wer bald schlafen ging, dem schickte sie den Sonnenuntergang ... Aber als dieser Rhythmus von Licht und Dunkelheit immer langsamer wurde, waren Tag und Nacht plötzlich fremd und furchteinflößend. Es war die Hölle auf Erden – die scheinbar ewige Hitze und die nicht enden wollende Kälte, die wie ein Sumpf alles Leben in die Tiefe zogen und unter sich begruben. Deshalb versammelten sich die Salsottianer, deren Überleben nun auf Messers Schneide stand, in der fliegenden Stadt, und begannen ihre ewige Jagd auf die Dämmerung.\\n\\nWer sich auf die Aussichtsplattform der fliegenden Stadt Steppenläufer begibt und in die Richtung blickt, in die sie sich bewegt, sieht dort das Tageslicht und hinter sich die Dunkelheit der Nacht.\\n\\nBei der Verfolgungsjagd der Stadt Steppenläufer geht es nicht nur ums Überleben, sondern auch um ein würdevolles Dasein.

Viele Beweggründe trieben sie hierher – manch einer war auf der Suche nach neuer Technologie, andere wollten sich eine goldene Nase verdienen – und so war die Grundlage für das Königreich gelegt.\\n\\nImmer mehr Diebe und Banditen ließen sich hier nieder, und der einst menschenleere Planet war nun voller Leben. Namhafte Diebe schwangen große Reden über ihre Ideale für ein Räuberkönigreich. Die Staatskasse solle dafür verwendet werden, eine Nation aufzubauen, die auf den Prinzipien der Fairness und Gleichberechtigung beruhte. Aber je mehr Reichtum sie anhäuften, desto schneller vergaßen dieselben Diebe ihre fadenscheinigen Versprechen und versuchten, den Wohlstand dieser Nation für sich selbst zu beanspruchen. Es folgten Söldner, Aufstände, Intrigen und Verrat ... Alles versank im Chaos. Womöglich hatten die Drahtzieher nie daran geglaubt, dass Ideale wie „Gleichberechtigung für alle“ hier Früchte tragen könnten.\\n\\nSo brach für die Diebe ohne Ideale ein chaotisches Zeitalter an, in dem Ignoranz an oberster Stelle stand. Sie eroberten Wasserquellen, um dort ihre eigenen Städte zu errichten, und hatten für Ideen wie „Fairness“ und „Gerechtigkeit“ nur Spott übrig.\\n\\nIn Alteisenstadt war jeder ein Bandit. Sie fuhren in zerstörerischen Geländefahrzeugen durch die Wüste und kämpften mit anderen Banditen um Ressourcen. Sie schufen mechanische Rüstungen und Waffen aus Eisenschrott und altem Draht ... Je karger die Einöde, desto mehr Freiheit genossen sie dort – ein letztes Hurra vor dem Jüngsten Gericht. Ihre süßen Träume verblassten in der Wüstenhitze zu traurigen Schatten des Unsinns, von denen es schon bald keine Spur mehr gab.\\n\\nHalb wach in Trance kamen die Diebe schließlich zu einer Erkenntnis: Bei dem Räuberkönigreich ging es nie darum, etwas zu schaffen. Es ging immer nur um Zerstörung."

Einst war es straff durch ein Raumschiff gespannt gewesen, aber ein übereilter Fluchtversuch eben jenes Schiffes erzeugte eine massive Schockwelle, bei der das Kabel freigelegt wurde und nun der Luftfeuchtigkeit ausgesetzt war.\\n\\nMan hatte das gesamte Raumschiff in ein Labyrinth aus unterirdischen Passagen verfrachtet. Auf dem Schiff der Diebe wurden Schilde aus Stahlplatten Schicht für Schicht abmontiert, und die Stromleitungen wurden brutal herausgerissen. Das Material wurde benötigt, um den ersten Allianzmarkt aufzubauen. Die Diebe häuften immer mehr Reichtum an und begannen, über ihre Ideale zu sprechen ... doch schon bald kam es zu langwierigen internen Machtkämpfen, bei denen Misstrauen und Verrat an der Tagesordnung waren. Die Flammen des Krieges zwischen dem Diktator und seinen Gegnern loderten bald nicht nur unter der Erde, sondern auch oben in der Wüste ...\\n\\nDieses freiliegende Kabel war sogar noch älter. Banditen gruben es aus einem Schlagloch aus und steckten es in ein aufgemotztes Geländefahrzeug, mit dem sie zu einer weit entfernten Wasserquelle fuhren. Das Kabel war dabei ständig von allen Seiten der Luft ausgesetzt.\\n\\nFür alle, die Krieg und Verrat überlebt hatten, war es die oberste Priorität, Talia nach Wasserquellen zu durchsuchen. In ihren schäbigen, schlecht verbauten Fahrzeugen fuhren sie durch eine Wüste, die von Glassplittern übersät war, und legten dabei täglich tausende Meilen zurück. Diese Banditenkarawanen jagten manchmal auch einander hinterher, wobei sie Staub- und Rauchwolken aufwirbelten. Ab und zu warfen sie auch willkürlich den ein oder anderen aus dem Auto – oder zerrten ihn hinein. Der Überlebenskampf hatte ihnen die Fähigkeit genommen, an mehr als das zu denken. Sie konnten ihrer Verwirrung nur entkommen, wenn sie sich ständig vorankämpften.\\n\\nDieses freiliegende Kabel war schon immer alt gewesen. Die Banditen entfernten es schließlich aus dem Geländefahrzeug und brachten es im Lichtkasten der Stadt an. Das alte Kabel brachte das Licht oft zum Flackern.\\n\\nEs war ein alter Gangster, der sich selbst als „Polizist“ bezeichnete, der Alteisenstadt gegründet hatte. Er hatte ein gewisses Charisma und war gut darin, den starken Mann zu markieren. So konnte er auf dem Schrottplatz Ordnung schaffen, und in der Stadt ging es langsam immer lebhafter zu. Exzentrische Ingenieure konstruierten Maschinen aus Abfall, und die verzweifelten Ödländer vertrieben sich die Zeit mit Kämpfen in der unterirdischen Arena ... Nachts saßen sie zusammen in einer Bar, in ihren Gläsern Traubensaft, der nach Benzin roch, und feierten die Tatsache, dass sie einen weiteren Tag überlebt hatten.\\n\\nAufTalia gab es nichts Neues, nur alte Dinge, die im Wechsel der Zeit immer wieder Verwendung fanden."

			"Vonwacq ist ein kleiner Planet mit wenig Platz, der fast zur Gänze mit Regenwäldern und Inseln bedeckt und von einer üppigen Tierwelt geprägt ist.\\n\\nDer unbändigen Lebenskraft des Planeten ist es zu verdanken, dass die Regenwälder in Äquatornähe so groß und hoch gewachsen sind, dass die Bäume den ganzen Himmel überdecken und nicht einmal Sonnenlicht durchlassen. Da die wärmende Sonne das ganze Jahr über das Unterholz nicht erreicht, gedeihen hier Pilze und andere lichtscheue Pflanzen zuhauf. Die intelligenten Wesen lebten in tropischen Gebieten. Dort wuchsen die Pflanzen unabhängig von ihrer Größe auf natürlichem Wege. Die Einheimischen ernährten sich hauptsächlich von frischem Obst und Gemüse, das jederzeit und überall verfügbar war.\\n\\nDen Tierfrüchten des Thestangbaumes wurde jedoch ein fast religiöser Respekt entgegengebracht. Dies galt sowohl für die neuen Immigranten als auch für die indigenen Wacqwacq-Wesen.\\n\\nDer große Thestangbaum trug immer Früchte. Anfangs waren sie oval, gelblich und durchsichtig, aber mit der Zeit wurden sie schwerer und schwerer, bis die Äste ihr Gewicht nicht mehr tragen konnten. Dann fielen sie mit einem lauten, knackigen Geräusch zu Boden, ihre dünne Haut platzte auf, und aus dem Inneren entsprang neues Leben. Ein jedes Tier auf Vonwacq wurde auf diese Weise geboren, sei es ein Fisch, ein Vogel oder ein Eisbär. Auf dem Planeten Vonwacq stammten Kreaturen aller Art von ein und derselben Mutter ab.\\n\\nDas dunkle Wesen, das man den „Dämonenkönig“ nannte, entsprang ebenfalls einer solchen Frucht des Thestangbaumes. Seit seiner Geburt hatte es instinktiv gewusst, wie es seine gewaltigen, axtartigen Zangen gegen andere richten konnte, und führte so einen Krieg gegen die gesamte Biosphäre von Vonwacq.\\n\\nAlle natürlichen sechzig Jahre brachte der Thestangbaum einen neuen Dämonenkönig hervor, und so begann der Kreislauf von neuem. Die Bevölkerung Vonwacqs hatte sich schon längst an diesen Zyklus des Verderbens gewöhnt. Sobald ein Dämonenkönig zu erwachen drohte, legten sie ihre Differenzen vorläufig beiseite und arbeiteten zusammen. Sie versammelten ihre mächtigsten Krieger und schickten sie auf die Reise zur Wacq-Insel ... So vergingen sechzig Jahre, und noch mal sechzig Jahre, und diese scheinbar sinnlosen Kreuzzüge fanden kein Ende. Jahrhundertelang prägten sie die schmale Landschaft dieses kleinen Planeten. Die Dämonenkönige waren das immer wiederkehrende Desaster von Vonwacq, und die Überreste der Zivilisation wurden immer wieder ausgelöscht.\\n\\nObwohl der Planet Vonwacq voller lebhafter Kreaturen war, die ununterbrochen gegeneinander kämpften, könnte man ihn also vielleicht eher mit einem stagnierenden Teich voll abgestandenem Wasser vergleichen."

Diese neugeborenen Kreaturen erwachten, schrien, und verließen dann die Wacq-Insel, um einen eigenen Lebensraum auf dem Planeten Vonwacq zu finden.\\n\\nDie Fremdlinge, die von den Sternen kamen, sah man erst nur als waghalsige Diebe. Nachdem ihnen die Stämme einen „freundlichen“ Empfang bereitet hatten, begannen sie, das zivilisatorische Dilemma von Vonwacq zu verstehen. Bald darauf segelten die Fremdlinge auf den Booten der Einheimischen zur Wacq-Insel. Sie waren neugierig darauf, wie ein Dämonenkönig aus einer Frucht geboren werden konnte. Beklommen legten die Stammeskrieger an der Sandbank an, ihre Steinzeitwaffen fest umschlossen. Ungewiss, ob sie jemals in ihre Heimat zurückkehren würden, zogen sie in den Kampf um sechzig Jahre des Friedens. Dabei schienen sie entschlossen zu sein, das ultimative Opfer zu bringen.\\n\\nDer Krieg dauerte an, und schließlich entdeckten die Fremdlinge die Wahrheit über den sogenannten „Dämonenkönig“ – es handelte sich um eine Spezies interstellarer Würmer, von der man einst angenommen hatte, sie wären ausgestorben. Es war mehr als unerwartet, dass diese Kreaturen in einer solchen Form und in dieser Ecke des Universums wieder auftauchen würden.\\n\\nAls die brutale Expedition endlich ein Ende fand, kehrten die wenigen überlebenden Einheimischen der Küste den Rücken zu, um daheim ihren Sieg zu verkünden. Die neugierigen Fremdlinge aber blieben still und heimlich zurück. Sie quetschten sich an den schlaffen Ästen des gewaltigen Baumes vorbei und versanken dabei halb im Morast. In dem versunkenen Regenwald stießen sie auf eine Steuerkabine, und so kam das große Geheimnis von Vonwacq endlich ans Licht – der Thestangbaum war ein Öko-Genesis-System einer weit fortgeschritteneren Zivilisation. Dieses war in der Lage, unzählige Lebensformen zu analysieren und dann in die Wildnis zu entlassen, um die Biosphäre des Planeten zu erneuern.\\n\\nDer Dämonenkönig, der immer wieder den Planeten verwüstet hatte, war nur ein einziger Eintrag in dieser enormen biologischen Datenbank gewesen. Die Fremdlinge löschten die Daten des Dämonenkönigs und verließen Vonwacq, ohne sich um die Anerkennung und Dankbarkeit der Einheimischen zu scheren.\\n\\nBis auf das Geräusch der Flutwellen, die gegen die Brandung schlugen, war es an der Küste der Wacq-Insel totenstill. Die Streitkräfte der einheimischen Koalition von Vonwacq standen in Reih und Glied. Jetzt waren sie sich sicher, dass der Dämonenkönig niemals wieder zurückkehren würde. Sie jubelten und begannen zu singen, sprachen Trinksprüche und unterhielten sich die ganze Nacht hindurch über eine Zukunft ohne Dämonenkönige. Aber fast sofort, nachdem sich die beiden verbündeten Stämme verabschiedet hatten und nach Hause zurückgekehrt waren, begannen sie, Pläne zu schmieden und Kriege zu planen, um ganz Vonwacq an sich zu reißen ... Ohne einen gemeinsamen Feind wie den Dämonenkönig war ihre Allianz nur ein wertloses Blatt Papier. Der kleine Planet konnte einem Konflikt zwischen den beiden Stämmen nicht standhalten. Dieser kurzlebige Frieden gehörte nun schon lange der Vergangenheit an.\\n\\nAn der Küste der Wacq-Insel war es ruhig, als hätte sich hier niemals etwas zugetragen. Nun, da sowohl Menschen als auch Wacqwacq von der Bühne verschwunden waren, hatte Vonwacq wahren Frieden gefunden und das Ökosystem wiederhergestellt."

			"Der Planet Taikiyan war einst ein Abstellplatz für alte Raumschiffe im Besitz der IFK, an den Gutachter versandt worden, um zu versuchen, die Wrackteile noch so gut wie möglich zu verwerten.\\n\\nEin Posten auf Taikiyan war für die Gutachter gleichbedeutend mit einem Exil ohne Rückkehr. Auf diesem winzigen Planeten türmten sich Berge aus Kohlefasern und rostfreiem Stahl. Gigantische Schiffe, die nur noch auf die Ausmusterung warteten, warfen ihre Schatten über die Leere dieser stählernen Ruinen. Niemand hielt es hier lange aus. Jahrelang bekriegten sich die Gutachter unter Deck, kämpften um wertvolle Einzelteile. Sie trugen Raketenanzüge mit modernen Antriebssystemen, in denen sie einander unentwegt durch die Korridore versunkener Schiffe jagten. In den Schatten dieser Unterwelt befolgten sie ihre eigenen Regeln ... Doch die sehnlichsten Wünsche dieser gefangenen Bestien wurden nie erfüllt. Kein Einziger kehrte jemals zurück.\\n\\nDie Regeln, die die Gutachter für ihr Untergrunddasein aufgestellt hatten, entgingen auch der IFK-Aufsicht nicht. Die Aufzeichnungen der von ihnen getragenen Kameras gelangten in die Hände der IFK und wurden zum Insiderwitz unter den hohen Tieren der Organisation. Der Investor der Abteilung für Traditionsprojekte dachte lange darüber nach und kam zu dem Schluss, dass man hieraus etwas „Entertainment“ gewinnen könnte.\\n\\nDer Plan sah vor, dass auf Taikiyan eine neue Sportart ins Leben gerufen werden solle: Taikiyan-Roboball. Dafür wurden mehrere transformierende Maschinen auf den Planeten entsandt. Die ausrangierten Raumschiffe wurden herausgerissen. Nicht ein einziger Schatten verblieb. Mit einem Schlag wurde der damals noch unbekannte kleine Planet zu einem imposanten Sportzentrum umfunktioniert, das sich ganz und gar um Roboball drehen sollte. „Niemand wird sich darum kümmern, wie das alles angefangen hat. Jetzt geht es nur noch um reinen Sportsgeist und profitable Handelsabkommen.“\\n\\nSportler in Raketenanzügen und Schutzausrüstung, dreidimensionale Rennbahnen, die sich ständig veränderten, Körper, die funkensprühend aneinander prallten ... Die Ankündigung der neuen Sportart versetzte die ganze Galaxie in Aufregung. Der Planet, der einst in Dunkelheit gehüllt war, sah seit jenem Moment keinen Schatten mehr.\\n\\nIn dem riesigen Stadion stehen Auswärts- und Heimmannschaft Kopf an Kopf und die lärmenden Publikumsmassen füllen die Kuppel bis zum Rand. Sie brüllen die Namen der Spieler in einer nicht enden wollenden Kakofonie. Auch außerhalb der Kuppel herrscht auf dem Planeten emsiges Treiben und auf dem Markt tobt der Kampf um Werbeverträge. Schwarze Wetten führen gleichermaßen zu Begeisterung und Enttäuschung. Die einst tintenschwarze Nacht ist mittlerweile nur noch die Leinwand, auf der sich die grellen Lichter des Stadions abzeichnen.\\n\\nSeit seiner Eröffnung hat das Taikiyan-Stadion die dunklen Nächte mit hellem Licht geflutet, sodass niemand mehr weiß, wo die verblassten Schatten versteckt liegen."

Er jagt ständig den Schwankungen der Phasenflamme hinterher und trägt so durch wilde Bewegungen zur Unberechenbarkeit des Spiels bei. Schließlich entwickelten Experten für Sportausrüstung einen standardisierten gepanzerten Raketenanzug für Roboball-Spiele. Auf diese Weise konnten die Marktführer in Sachen Sportausrüstung und Medizin ihr Können unter Beweis stellen und zugleich für Nachhaltigkeit sorgen, indem sie ein festes Einkommen und einen sicheren Wettbewerb gewährleisteten.\\n\\nDies war die Geburtsstunde des offiziellen Taikiyan-Roboballverbands und die erste Version der Taikiyan-Roboballspielregeln wurde ausgearbeitet. Zu dieser Zeit wurde auch das grundlegende Spielprinzip und die Aufteilung in zwei Mannschaften zu je sieben Spielern festgelegt.\\n\\nDie Architekten der Intelligenzia-Gilde hatten die Idee des „Rennens“ zu einer kreisförmigen, dreidimensionalen Rennbahn mit einer Standardlänge von <unbreak>2,91</unbreak> Kilometern erweitert. Der flache Mittelbereich der Rennbahn ist 5 Meter breit, während die gekrümmten Seitenabschnitte in der Breite von 2 bis <unbreak>14</unbreak> Meter variieren. Die Roboball-Spieler bewegen sich über mehrere Runden hinweg in einer Richtung über die weiträumige, hell erleuchtete Rennbahn. Die Geräusche von Kollisionen und ein beständiges Sausen begleiten sie das ganze Spiel hindurch. Tests haben ergeben, dass sich unzusammenhängende Lichtquellen mit dem Nachleuchten der Sportler vereinen, wenn sie sich mit hoher Geschwindigkeit über die Rennbahn bewegen. So bilden eine Vielzahl schwacher Lichter gemeinsam eine bestechende Lichtbogen-Rennbahn. Interastrales Friedensentertainment lud wohlhabende Individuen ein, der Liga beizutreten, um ihrem Lieblingssport die Aufmerksamkeit zu bringen, die ihm zustünde. Daraufhin wurden die Liga-Clubs ins Leben gerufen, in denen sich die talentiertesten Spieler versammelten. Alles war bereit.\\n\\nInterastrales Friedensentertainment hatte das exklusive Ausstrahlungsrecht für das Event und benutzte die hochmoderne Technologie der Ultra-Fernwahrnehmung, damit das Spektakel nah und fern gesehen werden konnte. Auch die Sinneseindrücke der Sportler während des Events wurden aufgezeichnet, damit Zuschauer die Geschwindigkeit, die Kollisionen, das Sausen und die Lichtbögen auch gemütlich von zu Hause miterleben konnten. Der alte Abstellplatz war nun ein Ziel für Besichtigungsreisen und brausende Menschenmengen versammelten sich in den Straßen, von Licht und Werbung erleuchtet, um sich langsam in das Stadion zu drängen. Sie nahmen ihre Sitzplätze ein, sahen sich um, und wurden von Bannern, Flaggen und nach Malzschaum duftender Luft begrüßt. Die Scheinwerfer schienen ihr Licht auf die stille Rennbahn.\\n\\nUnter dem Jubel der Menge fiel der Startschuss für das erste Spiel."

			"„Es begab sich eines Tages, dass der Palast der Götter vom Himmel fiel.“\\n\\nEs begann mit einem Schatten, der sich hinter den Luftschichten abzeichnete. Dann folgte ein feuriges Glühen, als er in die Atmosphäre eintrat, bis er schließlich seine wahre Gestalt offenbarte – die eines wundersamen Palastes von solcher Pracht, dass nicht einmal die größten Baumeister von Insumousu zusammen ihr das Wasser hätten reichen können. Er glitt langsam herab, als ob er sich aus dem Himmel selbst gebildet hätte. Der Ozean von Insumousu war groß, doch konnte er diesen göttlichen Palast aus der Höhe wirklich in sich aufnehmen? Niemand konnte sich sicher sein.\\n\\n„Inmitten des Chaos ergriffen manche die Flucht, verstreuten sich in alle Winde, während andere in den Dörfern an Land und unter dem Meer verblieben und den Himmelssturz erwarteten.“\\n\\nDie Xianzhou Daiyu stürzte auf Thalassa und schlug einen tiefen, wässrigen Krater ins Herz des Ozeans von Insumousu. Die Welt erbebte für sieben Planetentage. Wie die Überreste eines Gottes ruhten die atemberaubenden Ruinen still auf dem Meeresgrund, tragisch, aber herrlich. Die Überlebenden von Insumousu hatten schon immer unter den Wellen gelebt. Staunend und sorgenvoll mussten sie mitansehen, wie der himmlische Palast aus der Höhe ihre geliebte Heimat zerrüttete. Doch zu ihrer großen Freude fanden sie in den Überresten der Daiyu nach dem Himmelssturz ein neues Zuhause.\\n\\nMit den verbesserten Lebensumständen ging auch einher, dass das Volk von Insumousu mehr Zeit und Energie hatte, um zu denken. Als sie auf die atemberaubende Ruine blickten, die aus dem Himmel herabgefahren war, stellte sich ihnen die wichtigste aller Fragen: Wer waren „sie“? Und woher waren „sie“ gekommen?\\n\\nIn jenen frühen Tagen wusste das Volk von Insumousu nichts über die Kunst der Metallurgie. Auch die Schrift hatten sie noch nicht erfunden. Daher bedienten sie sich ihrer Vorstellungskraft, um die Lücken in ihrem Wissen zu füllen, und versuchten, durch das Geschichtenerzählen zu verstehen. So wurden „Legenden“ geboren. Diese wurden von Generation zu Generation weitergegeben und so wurden „Mythen“ geboren. Mythen formten die Wahrnehmung, die schließlich „Zivilisation“ gebar. Die Sterne zogen ihre Bahnen, Jahrhunderte kamen und gingen. Und Thalassa wurde ein Handelspartner der Xianzhou-Allianz. Endlich war es den Wasserbewohnern in Insumousu gewährt, zum ersten Mal den „Himmelspalast“ zu betreten. Dort wurden sie Zeuge der Erhabenheit der Xianzhou in ihrer Gesamtheit, und endlich erfuhren sie die Wahrheit über den Himmelssturz.\\n\\nDas gebildete Volk von Insumousu hatte sich stets als Erben der Daiyu gesehen. Sie sagen: „Was die Daiyu einst befolgte, sollen auch wir befolgen. Was die Daiyu einst bekämpfte, sollen auch wir bekämpfen.“ Wenn sie Geschichten aus ihrer Vergangenheit erzählen, beginnen sie stets mit diesen Worten:\\n\\n„Es begab sich eines Tages, dass der Palast der Götter vom Himmel fiel.“"

			"Als das Volk von Insumousu durch die Zivilisation aufgeklärt wurde, betrachteten sie die Verstorbenen des zerbrochenen Schiffes nicht mehr als gefallene Götter. Ihre Verehrung bleibt jedoch unverändert. So singen die Dichter von Insumousu: „Der Ozean mag die Sterblichen verschlingen, aber ihr Geist lebt ewig.“\\n\\nNach dem Kalender von Insumousu ist der zweite Ruhetag im Gezeitenmonat der „Tag des Himmelssturzes“. An diesem Tag zitieren die Wasserbewohner aus den Schriften, nehmen Kräuter zu sich und führen bizarre Tänze in den Strömungen auf, um die „Götter“ zu ehren, die vom Himmel gefallen sind und Insumousu ihren Segen gebracht haben. In der modernen Zeit hat der Tag des Himmelssturzes allmählich seine ursprüngliche religiöse Bedeutung verloren. Lieder ersetzen Schriften, Delikatessen die Kräuter, nur die seltsamen Tänze haben als Kulturerbe bis in die Gegenwart überlebt.\\n\\nIn den letzten hunderten Sternkalenderjahren haben Leute auf Insumousu ihre einzigartige Kultur großzügig mit der Außenwelt geteilt und die Form des Tags des Himmelssturzes hat sich allmählich geändert.\\n\\nIn den Landstädten von Insumousu wimmelt es meist von jungen Leuten – besonders am Tag des Himmelssturzes, an dem sie die Nacht hindurch singen und tanzen. Auswärtige Besucher, wie Touristen aus Xianzhou, nehmen zu dieser Zeit oft an den Feierlichkeiten teil, da sie sich in die pulsierende Atmosphäre der Städte verlieben, deren feurige Leidenschaft so unaufhaltsam ist wie ein Tsunami. Wenn die Wasserbewohner erwachsen werden, schrumpfen ihre Lungen allmählich, am Hals bilden sich Kiemen und ihre Hände, Füße und Augen passen sich an ein Leben unter Wasser an. Die Dichter sagen stets: „Die Bewohner von Insumousu schicken ihre laute, ungestüme Jugend an Land und verbringen das ruhige Alter im Ozean.“\\n\\nMit der Unterstützung der Himmlischen Handelsgilde der Xianzhou wurde bei den Feiern des Tages des Himmelssturzes ein neues Ritual eingeführt: Die Menschen tauchen in das Wrack der Xianzhou Daiyu, suchen nach den Überresten, bestatten sie auf Sternskiffen und entsenden diese in den Stern des Thalassa-Systems.\\n\\nDurch ihre Entdeckung der Geschichte von Daiyu haben die Menschen auf Insumousu auch die Tragödie ihres Absturzes erfahren. Als die Xianzhou Daiyu irreparabel beschädigt wurde und auseinanderbrach, traf Qingzhu, das Oberhaupt der Daiyu, eine mutige Entscheidung: Sie würde sich selbst und das Schiff opfern, um den Fluch der unsterblichen Plagen zu beenden. Die Xianzhou-Allianz hofft, dass die gefallenen Helden eine würdige Zeremonie zur Seelenberuhigung erhalten, und das Volk von Insumousu, das der Katastrophe entgangen ist, hat geantwortet.\\n\\nIrgendwann während der Nacht am Tag des Himmelssturzes kommen die Feierlichkeiten zu einem plötzlichen Ende. Jugendliche, Kinder und die Einwohner von Xianzhou sitzen am Strand, während die Erwachsenen aus dem Wasser kommen und ernst auf den Meereshorizont blicken. Danach durchbrechen mehrere Sternskiffe die Wasseroberfläche und fliegen vom Meeresgrund dem Stern entgegen.\\n\\nAlle Sternskiffe sind mit wunderschöner Kalligrafie von Insumousu verziert. Der Text besagt: „Du musst die Seile der ertrunkenen Matrosen lösen. Weine nicht. Nach meinem Untergang wirst du sicher weitersegeln.“"

			"Das Reich Welkin von Glamoth beherrschte ein riesiges Territorium, das sich über Zehntausende von Lichtjahren erstreckte, und sich immer weiter in den Kosmos hinein ausbreitete. Auf dem Höhepunkt der Macht des Reiches baute Ihre Majestät Kaiserin Titania eine prächtige Flotte und schwor, die Früchte der Zivilisation zu den unterentwickelten Grenzen zu bringen, um ihnen einen Vorgeschmack auf das Wohlwollen des Reiches zu geben und sie unter einer Herrschaft zu vereinen.\\n\\nDie Expedition wurde jedoch von endlosen Wellen wütender Insektoiden aufgehalten, die von Hinter dem Himmel kamen. Glamoths Armeen kämpften und scheiterten, wieder und wieder ... Kolonien wurden vernichtet, und von der stolzen Flotte wurde ein Schiff nach dem anderen vernichtet. Inmitten von Monstern mit Facettenaugen und armierten Flügeln waren die verzweifelten Schreie des Volkes von Glamoth nicht zu hören, und das Reich der Welkin war von da an dem Untergang geweiht.\\n\\nBis eines Tages Ritter in mechanischen Rüstungen vom Himmel herabstiegen und den sonnenverschlingenden Schwarm auslöschten. Seitdem reisen die silberweißen Eisenritter zwischen den verschiedenen Sternensystemen des Imperiums hin und her, durchqueren die verwüsteten Gebiete und kämpfen gegen die Katastrophe, die die Galaxie ausgelöscht hat. Sie waren wie Krieger, die für den Kampf gegen den Schwarm geboren wurden. Niemand wusste, was sich hinter den Masken der Eisernen Kavallerie verbarg, aber ihre Ankunft war wie ein Geschenk der Götter, das der menschlichen Welt das Licht des Tages zurückbrachte. Unter dem Kommando der Kaiserin stürmte Glamoths Eiserne Kavallerie über den Himmel, um endlich die Flut der Feinde einzudämmen und dem Reich einen Moment des Aufatmens zu bescheren.\\n\\nAber in der nicht enden wollenden Schlacht gegen den Schwarm wurde das Reich seinem Gegner immer ähnlicher – mehr und mehr Mitglieder der Eisernen Kavallerien flogen hoch in den Himmel und verdunkelten ihn genauso wie der Schwarm an jenem schicksalhaften Tag. Die positive Sicht, die die Menschen von der Kaiserin und der Kavallerie hatten, wurde zu einer Furcht; eine Furcht, die der ähnelte, die sie gegenüber dem Schwarm empfanden. Vielleicht würde das Imperium eines Tages den ersehnten Sieg erringen. Aber wird Glamoth an diesem Tag noch ein Paradies sein, in dem sich die Menschheit wohlfühlen kann?\\n\\nDas Regiment der Eisernen Kavallerie bildete die letzte Verteidigungslinie an der Grenze Glamoths, wo die Schlacht unaufhörlich weitergeschlagen wurde. Auf ihren Kriegsschiffen trugen die schweigsamen Ritter die Hoffnungen des gesamten Reiches und wehrten die Flut der Feinde ab, die die Sterne verdunkelten."

Eine andere Ansicht lautet, dass die Republik Glamoth dadurch zerstört wurde, dass sie ihren mächtigen Feind völlig überrannte.\\n\\nUm das Blatt in der schrecklichen Schlacht gegen den Schwarm zu wenden, warf der herrschende Rat den Fehdehandschuh hin und beschloss, das Wesen der Menschheit zu verändern, um sich an den Krieg anzupassen – sie wollten eine Waffe erschaffen, die „zum Kämpfen geboren“ ist.\\n\\nDas Ergebnis all dessen war „Titania“. Diese Kaiserin, die keine Macht besitzt, befiehlt und kontrolliert telepathisch die mit ihr verbundenen Ritter. In den Träumen, in die diese Krieger verwoben sind, besteht der einzige Sinn ihrer Existenz darin, Titania und ihr „Reich“ zu schützen. In ihrem kurzen Leben lernten und kämpften sie und nahmen die Befehle der Kaiserin entgegen, bevor sie sich furchtlos dem Feind stellten und ehrenvoll starben.\\n\\nNiemand wusste, wann diese Lüge aufgedeckt wurde. War es an dem Tag, als die Zahl der alten Menschen in Glamoths Territorien unter einen bestimmten Prozentsatz fiel? War es der Tag, an dem die Wissenschaftler erkannten, dass die Kaiserin begann, sich gegen ihr Gefangensein aufzulehnen? Oder ... vielleicht der Tag, an dem sich der Ansturm des Schwarms in Luft auflöste?\\n\\nAlles, was die Menschen wussten, war, dass die Eiserne Kavallerie alles für das nicht existierende „Imperium“ gab. Nach Jahrzehnten blutiger Kämpfe bildeten sich aus den Überresten von Mechas und Insektengliedern himmelhohe Trümmerhaufen, die im gesamten Sternensystem von Glamoth verstreut waren und zu einem „Fluss des Todes“ verschmolzen. Als die Überreste des Schwarms keine Bedrohung mehr darstellten, läuteten die Führer des Rates die Friedensglocken und teilten den Bürgern mit, dass sie die Apokalypse, die den Himmel vernebelt hatte, vertrieben hatten und die Republik wieder ins Licht des Tages zurückgeführt werden würde – was kam, war aber nicht das Licht des Tages, sondern der Beginn einer weiteren Nacht.\\n\\nDanach verschwand die Zivilisation, die als Glamoth bekannt war, und der lang ersehnte Frieden kehrte in den leeren Sternenhimmel ein – ein langer Fluss aus Sternenstaub und Trümmern, der lautlos durch die Leere zog."

Gäste aus anderen Gegenden trotzen der Schwerkraft und laufen an Wänden. Seltsame Spielzeuge erwachen zum Leben und ziehen feiernd durch die Straßen.

Das sternenübersäte Hotel ist das Juwel der Traumweber, das Reich der Traummacher und der Spielplatz der Traumsuchenden.\\n\\nNur wenige Gäste sind sich der Vergangenheit dieses Ortes bewusst – der Faden, mit dem ihre Träume gewebt sind, kommt aus der Realität. Die samtene Pracht des heutigen Penacony wurde aus salzigem Rost, schweren Fesseln und entzogener Freiheit geboren. Der Planet der Festlichkeiten war einst ein Gefängnis der IFK, in das unzählige Insassen verlegt wurden, um die überquellenden Erinnerungsblasen für den Garten des Gedächtnisses zu erhalten. Die Menschen schufteten so lange, bis ihre Körper so schwer wie Blei, ihre Seelen aber so leicht wie Blasen waren. Zu einem unbekannten Zeitpunkt wurden die kleinen Zellen von der Realität abgeschnitten, während das Bewusstsein der Menschen in Träumen miteinander verbunden wurde. Zur Mitternachtsglocke schien dieser gemeinsame Traum so real, dass er die schiere Heuchelei der Realität widerspiegelte.\\n\\nBis die Zerstörung die Ketten der IFK sprengte, verband der Trailblaze diese Grenze mit den Sternen, und die Harmonie kam auf Einladung, um die Saat des Friedens zu säen. Die Freiheit machte sich schließlich auf den Weg und gab dem ursprünglichen Traum einen neuen Namen – Penacony.\\n\\nHeute ist dieses Gefängnis spurlos zerfallen. In der Traumwelt wurden unzählige Wolkenkratzer errichtet und die Wüste wurde in eine Metropole verwandelt – ein neues Land für Träumer auf der Suche nach Reichtum und Möglichkeiten und ein Utopia für diejenigen, die nach Genuss und Vergnügen suchen. Die Vergangenheit des Planeten der Festlichkeiten ist wie ein Foto, das unwissentlich auf den Boden eines Schranks gefallen ist – es existiert, wird aber von niemandem gesehen.\\n\\nIn den heutigen Tagen ist das Land der Träume von Liedern der Freude erfüllt, und der Lärm der Vergangenheit wurde zu Klatsch und Tratsch, still vor sich hin existierend im Zwischenspiel einer Komödie, hinter den Kulissen eines Zeichentrickfilms oder in der Seitenspalte einer Zeitschrift."

			"Diejenigen, die Penacony besucht haben, werden zustimmen, dass „auf Träumen gebaut“ nicht nur ein Sprichwort ist, sondern insgesamt sehr real. Das opulente Hotel ist nur die Spitze des Eisbergs des Planeten der Festlichkeiten, und erst, wenn man „verweilt und träumt“, gilt man offiziell als auf Penacony angekommen. Von da an breitet sich das Land der Träume, das aus zwölf Traumlandschaften besteht, langsam vor den Augen der Gäste aus.\\n\\nGäste, die neu vor Ort sind, könnten von dieser Karnevalsbühne überwältigt sein, aber las dich nicht beunruhigen. Schau nach oben und du siehst die Metallschienen, die die Hochhäuser durchkreuzen, und die Sphäroiden, die schnell darauf entlangfahren. Sie sind die sichtbarsten Verkehrsmittel in dieser traumhaften Metropole und bringen Besucher an jeden Ort in der Stadt.\\n\\nAusgehend vom Hauptbahnhof bildet das komplizierten Sphäroid-Netzwerk quasi die Adern der Metropole. Ob es sich um die unterirdischen Tunnel des Augenblicks des Tagesanbruchs, die weiten Felder des Augenblicks des Flugsandes oder das glitzernde Stadion des Augenblicks der Sterne handelt, die farbenfrohen Sphäroiden fahren weiter und weiter und bringen die Menschen akkurat, effizient, sicher und bequem zu jeder Station, während sie die schlaflose Energie in die Traumwelt von Penacony gießen.\\n\\nTräume verleihen allem eine leichte und zarte Textur, und die nussartigen Sphäroiden werden im Land der Träume sowohl als Fahrzeuge als auch als Spielzeug betrachtet. Nur wenige wissen, dass es sich bei den Sphäroiden eigentlich um Käfige handelt – die Vehikel der Träumen sind Werkzeuge, die ursprünglich zum Einsperren von Gefangenen verwendet wurden.\\n\\nVor langer Zeit schickte die IFK eine große Anzahl von Gefangenen ins Sternensystem Asdana, um zu versuchen, den Verlauf einer Katastrophe aufzuhalten. Dort sammelten die Leute Memoria und verloren sich allmählich zwischen Fantasie und Realität. Die kugelförmigen Arbeitsräume im Vakuum wurden für die Gefangenen zu einer unvergesslichen „Erinnerung“ – die harten Innenwände, die schreckliche Erfahrung des Taumelns, die unerträgliche Anwesenheit jeden Tag – vielleicht saßen diese Schmerzen zu tief. Als diejenigen, die ihre Freiheit wiedererlangten, in die karge Traumwelt aufbrachen, nahmen sie die kugelförmigen Käfige mit.\\n\\nAber heute haben im Gegensatz zu früher Frieden und Freiheit einen Optimismus hervorgebracht. Anstatt zu versuchen, die unausweichlichen Alpträume immer wieder zu zerstören, ist es besser, sie so bunt anzustreichen, wie es dieser Ort sein sollte, sie anzunehmen und sie zu umarmen. So sind die kugelförmigen Käfige der Vergangenheit zu den Sphäroiden von heute geworden.\\n\\nIn der Gegenwart sind die sich schnell bewegenden bunten Sphäroiden, die überall in Penacony unterwegs sind, und der leichte Nachhall, der von ihnen ausgeht ... alle leise im Licht der Traumstadt verborgen und verschmelzen mit dem Ehrgeiz und dem Lachen, wie ein Land der Träume, in dem die Zeit für immer stillsteht."

			"Wenn man über Oswaldo Schneider spricht, den Leiter der Abteilung für Marketingentwicklung der IFK, werden häufig seine durchschlagenden Maßnahmen erwähnt, die er bei seinem Amtsantritt durchgeführt hat. Innerhalb von nur zwei Jahren nahm dieser junge Fanatiker drei gravierende Missstände in Angriff, die das Ministerium schon seit mehreren Bernsteinzeitaltern geplagt hatten, trotz bitterer Kälte, Pest und Tod, die damit einhergingen. Darunter war auch der trostlose Planet Sigonien-IV, von kargen Wüsten bedeckt und von Streitigkeiten zwischen den Klans gezeichnet ... ein Ort endloser Probleme und Konflikte.\\n\\nSigonien-IV liegt in der Nähe der Konvergenz dreier großer Sternhaufen und ist daher häufig den stellaren Winden mehrerer Sterne ausgesetzt. Daher rührt auch der Ruf des Planeten als „Auge des Sturms“ im gesamten Kosmos. Die Oberfläche des Planeten ist extrem unwirtlich, weshalb viele Zivilisationen entweder zu anderen Himmelskörpern abgewandert oder den Naturkatastrophen zum Opfer gefallen sind. Heute lebt dort nur noch eine kleine Anzahl intelligenter Spezies, die von den Gelehrten der Intelligenzia-Gilde als Sigonier bezeichnet werden.\\n\\nDie Sigonier sind in zahlreiche Klans aufgeteilt, von denen die meisten einen nomadischen Lebensstil pflegen. Nur wenige haben zentralisierte Regierungssysteme von bescheidener Größe errichtet.\\n\\nSie haben eine gemeinsame Sprache. In der vom Synästhesie-Leuchtfeuer bereitgestellten Übersetzung erfährt man, dass „Katica“ „Abhäutemesser“ bedeutet und das Symbol für den wildesten und barbarischsten Klan unter den Sigoniern ist. „Avgin“ hingegen bedeutet „Honig“; einige pedantische und sture Menschen bestehen darauf, dass die Mitglieder des Klans Diebe sind. Diese Klans führten in der grenzenlosen Wildnis, in der nur die Stärksten überleben, eine blutige Fehde gegeneinander, die mehrere Bernsteinzeitalter überdauerte – bis mysteriöse, schwarz gekleidete Gestalten vom Himmel herabstiegen. Die Sigonier waren vorübergehend unter dem Licht des Bernsteins vereint und der endlose natürliche Kreislauf fand schließlich ein zeitweiliges Ende.\\n\\nDanach gründeten die Sigonier unter der Führung der IFK die Sigonische Souveränität gemäß der Interstellaren Friedenscharta und machten ihre ersten Schritte zur Aufnahme in das zivilisierte Universum.\\n\\nBedauerlicherweise profitierten die Avginier und Katicaner nicht von dieser Einigkeit und dem Fortschritt. Einige böswillige Opportunisten unter den Sigoniern fürchteten sich vor dem Scharfsinn und der Gerissenheit der Avginier und verleumdeten die Katicaner als kannibalische Bestien. Obwohl sie nur wenig über die Bewahrung wussten, war ihnen klar, dass einige von ihnen dafür geopfert werden mussten. Mithilfe eines hoch entwickelten parlamentarischen Regelwerks verbannten die Korrupten beide Klans in die unendliche Wüste.\\n\\nAls Geste des Bedauerns versicherten sie, dass „die Avginier auf ewig das Recht auf Autonomie behalten würden“. Mit anderen Worten: Es war ihnen gesetzlich erlaubt, zu schweigen, wenn die beiden Klans in Zukunft wieder in Konflikt geraten würden."

			"„Avgin“ bedeutet „Honig“ in der Sprache von Sigonien. Dieser einst gängige Begriff ist nun längst in den Tiefen der kosmischen Geschichte versunken.\\n\\nMan sagt, es gibt keinen Rauch ohne Feuer: Die Avginier haben von Natur aus attraktive Gesichtszüge, verführerische Augen und besitzen eine außergewöhnliche emotionale Intelligenz, die es ihnen leicht macht, Fremde für sich zu gewinnen. Jedoch zieht dieses angeborene Talent den Neid und Groll anderer auf sich. Jene gierigen Snobs begannen ihre unaufhörliche Verleumdung, und diese Verurteilung der Avginier verbreitete sich wie ein Lauffeuer in der Galaxie. Die öffentliche Meinung hat die Macht, die Wahrheit zu verschleiern, und so konnten die Avginier, ein einfaches Volk von einem Grenzstern, schwerlich über ihr Leiden sprechen und mussten alle Arten von Argwohn schweigend über sich ergehen lassen.\\n\\nDie Avginier mögen kunstvoll verzierte Stoffe und Schmuck aus kostbarer Jade, wobei sie eine besondere Vorliebe für den sigonischen Kalameteorit haben. Nur dieser Edelstein ist laut ihrer Mythologie vergleichbar mit dem herrlichen göttlichen Körper von Gaiathra Triklop, der wiedergeboren worden sein soll.\\n\\nDie Muttergöttin ist als Fenge Biyos bekannt und herrscht über alles, was mit Fruchtbarkeit, Reisen und Täuschung zu tun hat. In der Religion der Avginier wird die Muttergöttin oft in Form einer linken Handfläche mit drei Augen dargestellt. Die Avginier drücken ihre Ehrfurcht vor ihr vor allem durch gesprochene Gebete aus, da sie glauben, dass die Muttergöttin so still und bescheiden ist wie die Berge von Sigonien. Das Errichten von Statuen oder das Komponieren von Hymnen würde sie aus der schützenden Umarmung der Muttergöttin reißen.\\n\\nDie Avginier sehen die Welt durch den Körper der Muttergöttin – die Erde, die Berge und alles, was auf dem Land existiert, sind ein Teil des göttlichen Leibes der Muttergöttin. Und am Ende eines jeden Kalenderjahres stirbt er.\\n\\nAn diesem symbolträchtigen Tag steigt ihre göttliche Essenz als leuchtende Aurora in den Nachthimmel auf und wird am nächsten Tag wiedergeboren. Daher feiern die Avginier den ersten Tag des neuen Jahres mit einem großen Fest namens „Kakava“. Während dieses Festes weben sie Opfergefäße, die sie „Knoten des Kreislaufs“ nennen, und werfen sie in Lagerfeuer, um die Wiedergeburt der Großen Göttin zu feiern.\\n\\nLaut dem Bericht der Abteilung für Marketingentwicklung kam es gerade in einer Nacht von Kakava zu dem Moment schockierenden Widerstands. Ungeachtet der stürmischen Winde und des bewölkten Himmels, der das Licht der Polarlichter verschluckte, feierten die Avginier in dieser Nacht ausgelassener denn je, obwohl solche Phänomene im Allgemeinen als schlechte Omen gelten. Als ein Mädchen aus dem Klan darauf angesprochen wurde, gab es folgende Antwort.\\n\\n„Der Regen ist ein Geschenk der Muttergöttin. Sie ruft uns und fordert uns auf, die Waffen zu ergreifen und für unsere Zukunft zu kämpfen.“\\n„Dieser Regen wird uns immer begleiten und beschützen. Im Regen werden wir auch ein ehrenvolles Ende finden.“"

Sie neigten ihre Köpfe und nannten das Land unter ihren Füßen „Izumo“; dann hoben sie ihre Köpfe und nannten die Welt im Himmel „Takamagahara“. Eines Tages stiegen „Yaoyorozu-no-kami“ aus Takamagahara herab. Diese bösen Bestien, die sich Götter nannten, ließen den Himmel einstürzen, die Meere brennen und den Erdboden zusammenbrechen ... Die Menschen waren schockiert, als sie feststellten, dass dies nicht eine Invasion zum Herrschen, Dominieren oder Plündern war, sondern dass die bösen Kami nur zur Jagd gekommen waren.\\n\\nZu dieser Zeit von Leben und Tod schlug Izumo den Weg des „Kami-Massakers“ ein, nutzte die gesamte Macht des Landes, um den schrecklichen „Gott der Offenbarung“ zu töten, und schmiedete seinen tierischen Körper zu dem ursprünglichen „Ediktschwert“. Durch das Rezitieren des in die Klinge eingravierten Mantras konnte ein Schwertträger Takamagaharas göttliches Schicksal in den Händen halten, um die bösen Taten der Götter zu vergelten, sie zu bekämpfen und die Welt zu retten. Daraufhin begann das Reich Izumo einen langen Eroberungszug, bei dem im Gegenzug für den Sturz eines Gottes nach dem anderen unzählige Opfer gebracht wurden, tausende Schwerter zerbrachen und schließlich die zwölf „Ediktschwerter zum Schutze der Welt“ geschmiedet wurden.\\n\\nIn diesem grausamen Überlebenskampf nutzte das Reich Izumo die Macht der Ediktschwerter, um die barbarische, dunkle Welt zu erhellen und schillernde Stadtstaaten zu errichten. Das einst unerreichbare Reich der Götter war nun in greifbare Nähe gerückt ... Doch die Geschichte fand in diesem Moment ein jähes Ende, als sich die Existenz zweier Planeten in Luft auflöste und sie spurlos verschwanden.\\n\\nHeute ist die Vergangenheit des Grenzsterns Izumo nur noch in wenigen Aufzeichnungen im Universum zu finden. Gelehrte sind sich über seinen Untergang uneinig, und niemand konnte das Rätsel lösen. Die Geschichte von Izumo hätte ein langer, fließender Fluss sein sollen, aber er wurde mit einem Messer durchtrennt, sodass die gesamte Vergangenheit und Zukunft im Nichts verschwand. Hat Izumo etwa nie existiert und ist nur eine erfundene Geschichte? Ist dies alles etwa Fantasie, eine Verwechslung von Ursache und Wirkung? Handelt es sich um ein weiteres schreckliches Experiment von „Dr. Primitiv“, oder ist es ein Vorbote für die Rückkehr der Gier vom Ende des Kosmos?\\n\\nDie Antwort kennt nur die große, dunkle Sonne. Doch sie schweigt für immer.\\n\\nDenn alles, was geschehen ist, muss zu einem Ende kommen, und alles, was zu einem Ende gekommen ist, muss wieder geschehen.

			"Izumos Klingen von Ende und Anfang",
			"Zwei Planeten, einander verwoben in ein tragisches Schicksal, und eine längst verlorene Ballade erklingt an der himmlischen Felshöhle.\\n\\nDieses Lied hat weder Anfang oder Ende noch Klang, es kommt aus niemandes Mund und dringt an niemandes Ohr. Es steht geschrieben wie folgt:\\n\\n<i>Takamagahara, fern wie Izumo, Land der gar höchsten Glückseligkeit.</i>\\n<i>Finster sind dort Himmel und Erde, große Sonne lenkt die Gezeiten, so rauscht Götterwanderung hinab auf dem Fluss der Zeit.</i>\\n<i> Yaoyorozu-no-Magakami schlachteten ab ganz ohne Gnade, ahnten nicht, dass gestohlen würde ihre Unsterblichkeit.</i>\\n<i>Siebzigtausenddreiunddreißig Schwerter Izumos brachen entzwei, geschmiedet der Ediktschwerter zwölf, zum Schutze der Menschheit.</i>\\n\\n<i>Eins ist „Wahrheit“, gegossen mit dem „Gott der Offenbarung“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche alle Gesetzesprinzipien erkennen, alles dekonstruieren zur Erschaffung von Wundern.</i>\\n<i>Zwei ist „Himmel“, gegossen mit dem „Ehrwürdigen des Himmels“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche den Himmel zur Wand machen und Magatsu-no-Morokami den Durchgang erschweren.</i>\\n<i>Drei ist „Vogelsang“, gegossen mit dem „Donnergott“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche ein Loch in den Himmel reißen, durch die Macht des Donners himmlische Strafen verhängen.</i>\\n<i>Vier ist „Bergnebel“, gegossen mit dem „Gott des Windes“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche erderschütternde Winde herbeirufen, Wolken und Regen in gewaltigen Orkanen tosen lassen.</i>\\n<i>Fünf ist „Frost“, gegossen mit dem „Himmlischen Wintergewand“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche Zeit einfrieren, schier endlose eisige Flächen erschaffen.</i>\\n<i>Sechs ist „Leben“, gegossen mit dem „Ewigen Gestein“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche tote Hügel zum Blühen bringen, den Fluss von Leben und Tod spurlos verschwinden lassen.</i>\\n<i>Sieben ist „Brand“, gegossen mit dem „Schicksal des Feuers“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche alles in Schutt und Asche legen, selbst den Himmel in Brand setzen.</i>\\n<i>Acht ist „Gefühl“, gegossen mit dem „Weisheitsgott“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche im Wasserspiegel die Zukunft erkennen, Tausende von Generationen nicht Falsches und Wahres sehen.</i>\\n<i>Neun ist „Fundament“, gegossen mit dem „Großen Bergherrn“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche Inseln hoch im Himmel hängen, Berg wie Tal vor den Truppen wegbröckeln lassen.</i>\\n<i>Zehn ist „Tausend“, gegossen mit dem „Gott der Unterwelt“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche alle Menschen der Welt zu einer Einheit verbinden, die Gezeiten nach Belieben steigen und fallen lassen.</i>\\n<i>Elf ist „Bund“, gegossen mit dem „Schutzgott“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche alle Pfade in Käfige fehlleiten, böse Geister und alles Übel verschwinden lassen.</i>\\n<i>Zwölf ist „Mahl“, gegossen mit dem „Gott des Unglücks“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche die langlebige Welt zerfallen lassen, die Grenzen zwischen Göttern und Geistern verwischen.</i>\\n\\n<i>Welten hinweggefegt, Kämpfe entbrannt, zwölf Strahlen gebrochen entzwei;</i>\\n<i>Die Wüste leer, schwarze Sonne so klar, Last der Welt auf zwei Schwertern voll Ehre.</i>\\n<i>Der Anfang weilt im ersten, dem zweiten gehört das Ende; eins ist der Mensch und der Geist ist zwei.</i>\\n<i>Ein Bruch und die Stimmen schweigen still, Pracht der Blumen verfallen und welk. Der Verlierer kehrt zurück ins Nichts, der Gewinner wird zur Leere.</i>\\n\\nEin humpelnder Mönch sang das unmelodische Lied und diejenigen mit göttlichen Kräften zogen sich zu den Göttern zurück.\\nUnter dem Blick der großen Sonne, auf dem Land, das einst als Izumo bekannt war, sind Menschen, Götter und Geister ... nirgendwo mehr zu finden."
