His flesh twitched and throbbed beneath his skin, like river carps flipping and swarming...

It is said that was when the Watchmaker entered the fray. His eyepiece reflected the essence of this Dreamscape — People spend like wastrels in the Moment of Dusk only to \"seek the impossible in dreams.\" From then on, Penacony's dreams started to contain many incredulous objects: Teapots that can tell jokes, race cars that twirl as they drive, and mansions that switch their location every day... Most of them are utterly useless, however they are being sold at astronomical prices. And those who visit from afar are willing to toss mountains of cash for them.\\n\\nThis is a fantastical Dreamscape, so why not indulge in madness? The words \"Exclusive and only in the dream\" are enough to redefine the worth of luxuries in the Dreamscape.\\n\\nThe Alfalfa Family and old Dreamchasers from the commercial world often feel regret about this, lamenting that they did not spot these opportunities at earlier times. The Watchmaker simply saw a bit further than them — Just a bit further every time."

			"\"As you command. I committed sins. I falsely claimed that various lineages were divided and exchanged this hearsay misinformation for payment...\"\\n\\nThrough the partition, the family head catches the journalist's evasive gaze as the penitent nervously awaits his response — a ritual of confession he had done countless times when his consolations ring out like bells to let the faithful repent for their sins. However, this time he subconsciously turns his head, trying to say something but stopping himself, letting his metal earrings emit a crisp noise next to his ears.\\n\\n\"I'm fully aware that this claim is completely groundless. Thanks to the grace of the Great One, all Family members stand united as one. This is the collective desire of all lineage members, and their reason for devoutly embracing the Great One.\"\\n\\nThe penitent confesses his sins, resolves to amend his mistakes, and seeks absolution from their evil via the harmonic tunes. The family head closes his eyes gently and utters the sacred benediction.\\n\\n\"Very well. Show your sincerity to the other Family members and dispel those rumors. In this way, you shall be reinstated with harmony. Now, please leave in peace.\"\\n\\nWhat sin is there in speaking truth? His dictates are crystal clear but are burdened like a yoke.

Countless in quantity, they were difficult to store, and she couldn't be bothered to manage them herself.\\n\\nThe generous and charitable Interastral Peace Corporation then proposed a solution and that was how the Herta Space Station, where wisdom and secrets are stored, was born. Comprehensive containment measures were made throughout the space station, all in the pursuit of organizing everything in the collection with order and clarity. Phenomena were stored in specialized containers while Curios were regulated in indices. Innumerable items were categorized and classified, then stored deep within the station for research.\\n\\nThe IPC then proposed a collaboration in exploring the secrets of the stars together, which brought curious and adventurous scholars into the station to conduct research.\\n\\nMost of them admired Madam Herta, vowing to never abandon their ethereal aspirations and explore the secrets whispered among the stars. They investigated the star systems and realms of living beings, debated true justice in discourses on ethics and philosophies, outlined valleys and peaks within galaxies, deciphered secrets behind religious rituals and ceremonies, held on to the way of seeking truth from practice... They were the true believers of passing knowledge to posterity, and practiced unrestrained and divergent research.\\n\\nHowever, once the space station moved into orbit, it started to operate on its own and Madam Herta rarely showed herself. It was then that the IPC realized the whole station was filled with the mundane daily activities of the researchers, yet the genius was nowhere to be seen.\\n\\nLight from different zones rendered people unaware of the passage of time, the traces of which could only be detected in the burnt out lifestyle in the station. Often a smattering of researchers would argue non-stop about a particular piece of collection, even going so far as to start a fight. Occasionally a security officer would be absent from their daily patrol and nap instead on their military-styled bunker. Sometimes senior researchers would share with their younger peers tales of past romances, while some big shots would disguise themselves as temporary workers to bid their time for the next big turn of luck... Besides research, there was also life. They just had to look outside the hull — for the stars were journeying with them.\\n\\nDespite all the limitations, the researchers still talked about the everyday life in the space station in their own romantic way — The cosmos was a profound epic poem, and Herta Space Station was slowly cracking open the poetry collection."

Madam Herta collected them all when she was in the mood, but would often lose interest once she got her hands on them.\\n\\nHence, though the space station appears to be floating peacefully in space, its treasure hoard of multi-shaped crises hung above it like a sword waiting to fall.\\n\\nSenior researchers had long been aware of the dangers they faced, and understood that \"secrets lie deep within danger.\" They strictly adhere to confidentiality agreements and faithfully carry out regulated containment procedures, thus burying danger within an outward silence... In the cafeteria, they were friends who could joke around. Yet, deep in the bowels of the space station's storage zones, they were highly skilled experts.

In this lonely voyage, people slumbered, woke up, and slumbered again in incessant alternation... Star-chasing whales fell from the dome of heaven, and crystalline entities made of subgrain lattice managed to span light years without a single crack. The Elixir Seekers witnessed the majesty of various supernatural powers. In covert delight, they further hardened their resolve to obtain immortality.\\n\\nAfter voyaging for thousands of years, the Xianzhou Luofu gradually came to a halt, whereupon it encountered the master of Abundance in the limbo between the reality and the imaginary. Yaoshi bestowed a divine miracle upon the ship, and it immediately manifested as the Ambrosial Arbor. Its shade was as large as clouds, blocking out the sky and sun. Its roots were thick and dense, enveloping the entire Xianzhou ship — the Luofu seemed to be brought to life.\\n\\nThose who coveted immortality swallowed the fruit of the Ambrosial Arbor, and finally obtained the Endless Lifespan they had dreamed so much about. The Xianzhou residents began to claim they were celestial beings worthy of endless lifespans in abundance, and they also learned to use the Ambrosial Arbor to create various inhuman marvels via the blessings of immortality.\\n\\nYet, just like the shifting of the sun and moon, what once prospered was fated to decline and what once brought elation must eventually induce agony. It was not until the arrival of the Three Sufferings, when people were tormented to near extinction, that the Xianzhou people finally came to understand the true nature of this so-called miracle, which was nothing but harrowing calamity.\\n\\nIn the midst of disaster, a hero rose with the Reignbow and split the Ambrosial Arbor in half. The Xianzhou people regained their dignity as humans, and vowed to return to mortality and purge all deathless doom in this universe. In the ensuing years, Xianzhou went on a hunt across the stellar seas, taking it upon themselves to purge all deathless abominations. The foxians regained their freedom and took back control of the sky, while the Vidyadhara sealed off the contamination and any residual catastrophes. The three races were then brought together in a covenant and coalition. Thus was born the Xianzhou Alliance.\\n\\nProsperity and calamity came and went in cycles during the voyage. Heroes and legends rose to fame and glory one after another as history marched on. Now, the Xianzhou Luofu is healing and reconstructing in a period of hard-won peace. Free trade and open minds truly brought it back to life.\\n\\nImmortality had permanently molded the Xianzhou Luofu. With its ups and downs through history, the Xianzhou Luofu accumulated its own unique aura that combined both antiquity and modernity.

			"The master of Abundance buried the seed of karma in the center of the Xianzhou Luofu and gifted the Elixir Seekers with something named \"Ambrosial Arbor,\" which was considered a miracle as people were able to immediately understand its implications.\\n\\nThe Ambrosial Arbor grew fruits of divinity that brimmed with life and vitality, containing the Endless Lifespan sought by the Elixir Seekers. From that moment, the ancient taboos and laws were rendered useless, and nature's dictum and ethics regarding aging and death became irrelevant history. People followed the way of immortality to exploit the Ambrosial Arbor with increasing intensity, making Fallow Earth that never exhausted itself, molding their own bodies to shapeshift, and giving the gift of thinking and talking to animals... Innumerable unimaginable technologies were brought into existence under the branches of the Ambrosial Arbor.\\n\\nHowever, the Ambrosial Arbor took off its disguise as time went by, revealing its hideous visage as the agony of immortality crept upon the immortals.\\n\\nThe celestials ceaselessly reproduced, yet tasted no death. The ship groaned from overpopulation, as hunger and starvation tormented many. Xianzhou's young can never realize their life's ambitions while their elders clang to power, and society teetered at the edge of structural collapse... Rebellions of the aurumatons and external invasions marked a ruinous millennium, after which the darkness hidden in immortal bloodlines also showed its face. The so-called \"Body of Celestials\" was simply a technology that surpassed human intellect. The propensity to be stricken with mara was a warning to all Xianzhou natives, a reminder that they were a mere step away from becoming abominations themselves.\\n\\nIn desperation, a hero tore through the sky with a powerful shot from their bow, splitting the Ambrosial Arbor in half... Yet even if all there was left of the Ambrosial Arbor was a burnt stump, the fate of Xianzhou could never be separated from it.\\n\\nIt attracted external forces to invade Xianzhou. The Abominations of Abundance launched multitudes of assaults, where flesh was distorted and blood was spilled, for the sole purpose of devouring Xianzhou whole. The Arbor also tempted the Xianzhou residents. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus broke the taboos and ventured deep into the secret of Abundance within the Ambrosial Arbor, hoping to reforge the once mighty immortal empire... In the long days of foreign and domestic troubles, the remaining corpus of the Ambrosial Arbor lurked like unending vines propagating in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to wreak havoc again.\\n\\nFortunately, the Xianzhou Luofu never lowered its guard against the withered tree. The people had vowed to cast this source of all distortions into the end of all things."

Those who claimed to have received the oracle of the god began to act, wishing to help the Aeon Qlipoth to build the wall.\\n\\nThe universe is in imminent peril, and the building of the wall cannot wait. The puny humans had no intention of imitating the feats of the god, instead gathering into a self-proclaimed \"support team\" for the Aeon, willing to devote everything to the Amber Lord. With the power of Preservation, the support team piloted their fleet to different stellar systems to purchase building materials such as stone, wood, gold, and supernium, then tirelessly transported these to the subspace barrier, piling the items on the planetary wasteland.\\n\\nAfter the end of the short development period, the support team took a firm foothold in Pier Point and established the Interastral Peace Corporation. In order to fully carry out their devotion, they turned their sights to deep space.\\n\\nLouis Fleming raised a call for action, and the long-distance trade fleet left the star systems adjacent to Aeon Qlipoth. Their commodities were no longer limited to building materials... They plan to connect the whole Cosmos and trade everything. Soon after, Dongfang Qixing implemented Cosmos-wide trade regulations and built a \"credit\" system to set a price for everything across the universe. Trillions of assets gathered under their megastructure on Pier Point. Like a silent black hole, the building destroyed people's notions about the limits of wealth.\\n\\nToday, the ships of the Interastral Peace Corporation are all over the Cosmos. Despite being criticized as a corporate dictatorship, the IPC has not stopped expanding. They don't care what other people think and have never forgotten their founding mission.\\n\\nThe IPC's recruit training methods change with each passing day, but after nearly eight hundred Amber Eras, there is only one historical practice that never changed. Once upon a time, Louis Fleming, the founder of the IPC, stood in front of the support team and made a passionate speech. He put forward the aspiration of uniting the universe and supporting the Aeon's wishes to protect the universe. As soon as the speech ended, the distant and huge sound of a cosmic impact sounded, injecting a lofty calling into this solemn and sublime moment. From that moment on, they knew this would become their unswerving belief.\\n\\n\"All for the Amber Lord.\""

The Aeon Qlipoth has no intention of accepting these eager gifts, instead always solely focused on the crisis that will befall the unsuspecting mortals, having to cast the gargantuan barriers measured in light years.

			"Regarding the origin of mechanical life, the carbon-based scholars of the Intelligentsia Guild have a unique speculation: A cluster of electrons born by chance.\\n\\nElectric currents flow throughout the atmosphere and ground. It separated into secondary forms of different magnitudes under the countless acts of gravity and repulsive forces. According to the scholars' hypothesis, this action is tantamount to cell division in carbon-based life. Thereafter, currents randomly output different potentials via the transistor structure naturally formed on the planetary surface, creating the most primitive program. The proud scholars argued that in this way, machines have \"thoughts\" that are comparable to carbon-based life.\\n\\nA mechanic objected to this: How can carbon-based life, which has not even been able to understand the origin of their own beings, have the gall to spout such fallacies? As soon as the words came out, the academic world of the universe was shaken to the core. Mechanical life began to re-examine the arrogant \"carbon-based centrism\" and examine its own origin.\\n\\nHowever, the Screwllumites on the Planet Screwllum had no choice but to pause their march — their planet's energy was being exhausted faster than their inspiration circuits. They needed to first find a way for their population to survive.\\n\\nIn the end, they decided to carry out an extreme plan that transcended several Amber Eras: They used the dying planet as fuel to power the Celestial Differentiator. The awe-inspiring, gigantic gear tirelessly processed the punched tape, methodically repeating calculations. With its planetary energy supply, the huge machine simulated a bona fide and stable superecosystem. They would then build their new home around this parent star.\\n\\nWith their planetary crisis lifted, the Screwllumites could rest. Always rational, optimistic, and elegant, they are determined to explore the answer to their origins in a purely rational manner.\\n\\nThe massive system is filled with the sound of bearings grinding against each other, and the dense teeth of cogs drive the punched tape to churn out data. One branch flows into multiple branches, and countless branches guide trillions of gears to roar... Then, these branches collapse again and again, falling into the furnace and returning to silence in the bubbling core. Over a long period of time, the programmed super-ecosystem gradually became a wonderful and relatively stable one. Eventually, speculations about the origins of machines began to cause Screwllumites' imaginations to wander.\\n\\nThe steel construct that drives the dying star once again activated their intelligent thought circuits.

They seized water sources to build towns of their own and mocked the very idea of fairness and justice.\\n\\nEveryone in Nailscrap Town was a bandit. They drove violently destructive off-road vehicles and fought for resources with other hordes of bandits in the desert. They created mechanical armor and weapons out of scrap iron and old wires... The more barren the wasteland was, the more freedom they got out of it, like one final frenzy before doomsday. Those sweet dreams were like wisps of nonsense in the radiating heat waves and had long ceased to leave any trace behind.\\n\\nIn a half-awake trance, the thieves came to the realization that the Kingdom of Banditry was never about creation but about destruction."

It had once been neatly lined up on a starship until one hasty escape attempt of the starship led to a huge shock wave, which subsequently exposed the wire to the moisture in the air.\\n\\nThe entire starship was dragged into a labyrinth of underground passages. On the thieves' starship, shields made of steel plates were removed layer by layer, and the power lines were crudely stripped apart, all of which were then used to build the first-ever alliance market. The thieves there began to accumulate wealth and at the same time started to talk about their ideals. Soon after, the protracted infighting began, where suspicion and betrayal were expressed by and against one another. The flames of the war fought between the dictator and their detractors eventually spread from the underground tunnel to the surface-level desert grounds...\\n\\nThis exposed wire was even older. It was dug out of a pothole by the bandits and then connected to a revamped overland vehicle with air leaking in from all directions, which was driven to a distant water source.\\n\\nThe top priority for all survivors of the war of betrayal was to locate Talia's water sources. They drove thousands of miles a day on deserts littered with glass shards in extremely shabby and poorly made vehicles. The caravans of the bandits sometimes chased each other, raising dust and heavy smoke, and other times they just wantonly threw people on or off the car... The sheer pressure of survival forced them to give up all other thoughts. Only by forging ahead could they be saved from confusion.\\n\\nThis naked wire was always old. It was further removed from the overland vehicle and placed into the town's lightbox by the bandits. The aging wire caused the lights to flicker frequently.\\n\\nIt was an old gangster who claimed to be the \"police officer\" who founded the original Nailscrap Town. With his strongarm tactics and charisma, he managed to keep the junkyard in good order. The town became livelier than ever. Eccentric engineers accidentally made machinery out of waste, and desperate wastelanders also enjoyed fighting back and forth in the underground arena... Late at night in a bar, they filled their glasses with grape juice that smelled like gasoline and cheered together, celebrating the fact that they had managed yet another day of survival.\\n\\nThere was nothing new in Talia, just old things repurposed differently in changing times."

			"Vonwacq is a small and crowded planet, almost entirely covered by rainforests and islands, with its exuberant wildlife being its most recognizable feature.\\n\\nVonwacq's effervescent vitality made the rainforests near its equator grow so large and tall that their shades would cover the sky above and even block out the sun. The lack of sunlight in the undergrowth of the rainforest throughout the year creates a perfect space for fungi and other low-light plants to grow. Intelligent creatures inhabited regions near the tropics. Plants, irrespective of height, would grow naturally here. Fresh fruits and vegetables could be picked at any time and anywhere, which was what the locals mostly fed on.\\n\\nHowever, be it the new immigrants or the indigenous Wacqwacq beings, they have always maintained a quasi-religious reverence for the animal fruits growing on the Thestang tree.\\n\\nThe great Thestang tree never stopped bearing fruit, not even for a moment. With time, all those yellowish and translucent oval-shaped fruits grew larger and heavier, hanging down from the branches until the stems could no longer bear their weight. When the time came, fruits would fall to the ground with a loud and crisp sound, cracking their thin skin and releasing whatever was held within. The fauna of Vonwacq was all born this way, be it fish, birds, or polar bears. On Planet Vonwacq, creatures of all kinds shared one common birth mother.\\n\\nThe fiend known as the \"Demon King\" was also born from one such fruit of the Thestang tree. From the moment of its birth, it instinctively knew how to swing its giant ax-like pincers toward others, waging war upon the entire biosphere of Vonwacq.\\n\\nEvery sixty natural years, the Thestang tree would give birth to a new demon king, and the cycle went on and on. The people of Vonwacq had long been used to and prepared for such cyclical fates of doom. Whenever a demon king's awakening approached, they would temporarily set aside their disputes and work together, assembling their strongest warriors to set sail for Wacq Island... One sixty years after another sixty years, these seemingly pointless crusades had been launched over and over again for hundreds of years in such narrow landscapes on this small planet. The demon kings were the permanent disaster of Vonwacq, and the caches of civilization were periodically wiped out.\\n\\nThus, it could be said that Planet Vonwacq was more like a stagnating pool of dead water, even though it was teeming with lively creatures that were ceaselessly fighting with each other, seemingly full of possibilities for change."

Then these creatures awakened, cried, and subsequently left Wacq Island to seek a habitat of their own on Planet Vonwacq.\\n\\nAt first, the outsiders from the stars were seen as reckless thieves who, upon receiving a \"friendly\" tribal welcome, began to understand the civilizational dilemma of Vonwacq. Soon after, the outsiders boarded the locals' boats and sailed to Wacq Island, curious about how a demon king would be born from the fruit. The tribal warriors lay low on the shoals in trepidation, closely clenching their Stone Age weapons. To fight for sixty years of peace, they seemed determined, ready to make the ultimate sacrifice, one where they may never return home.\\n\\nAs the war went on, the outsiders discovered the truth about the \"Demon King\" — It was a species of interstellar worm that had once been considered extinct. It was simply unexpected that these creatures would appear in such a form in this corner of the universe.\\n\\nWhen the brutal expedition was finally over, the surviving few natives left the coastline with news of their victory, while the curious outsiders quietly stayed behind. They pushed aside the drooping branches of the giant tree and sank into the quagmire, almost half-submerged. In the sunken lands of the rainforest, the outsiders found a control cabin. It was then that the secret of Vonwacq was finally revealed — the Thestang tree turned out to be the eco genesis system from a much higher civilization, which could decode and then release innumerable life forms to restore the planet's biosphere.\\n\\nThe demon king that cyclically rampaged the planet turned out to be just one single piece of data in the vast biologic database. The outsiders deleted the data of the demon king and then left Vonwacq, not seeking any credit or gratitude from the locals.\\n\\nThe sound of tidal waves battering against the seaside land was the only audible sound on the coastline of Wacq Island. The indigenous coalition forces of Vonwacq were all lined up and were convinced that the demon king would never come again. Then they cheered, toasted, sang, and talked all night about a future without demon kings. However, almost immediately after the two allied tribes bid farewell and returned to their respective homelands, the two tribes began plotting wars for their takeover of the whole of Vonwacq... Without a common threat such as the demon king, their alliance was but a non-binding piece of paper. The small planet was never designed to withstand a conflict between the two tribes. And the short-lived, fragile peace had since shattered out of existence.\\n\\nThe coastline of Wacq Island remained in its enigmatic calm as if nothing had ever transpired on these shores. With humans and Wacqwacq gone from its center stage, Vonwacq had finally reclaimed peace and completed its ecological restoration."

Out here, the exiles' desire to be recalled intensified to a boiling point. Assessors wearing propulsion equipment fought for high-quality parts below-deck for many years, their lightning-fast figures mutually fleeing from and in pursuit of each other in the corridors of sunken ships.

Several planet terraforming machines descended to the surface and yanked out the decommissioned spaceships in their entirety, not leaving a single inch of their former shadows behind.

Another view claims that the Republic of Glamoth was destroyed by how it completely overshot its powerful enemy.\\n\\nIn order to turn the tide in the horrific invasion of the Swarm, the ruling council threw down the gauntlet and resolved to alter the essence of humanity in an effort to adapt to the war — they will create a weapon \"born to fight.\"\\n\\nThe result of all this was \"Titania.\" The Empress, who holds no power, telepathically commands and controls the knights connected to her. In the dreams that these warriors are woven into, the sole meaning of their existence is to guard Titania and her \"empire.\" In their short lives, they studied, fought, received the Empress' commands, faced the enemy fearlessly, and died with honor.\\n\\nNo one knew when this falsehood was revealed. Was it from the day when the old humans in Glamoth's territories fell below a certain percentage? Was it the day when scientists realized that the Empress was beginning to revolt against her captivity? Or... maybe the day when the Swarm's onslaught dissipated into thin air?\\n\\nAll the people knew was that the Iron Cavalry gave their all for the non-existent \"empire.\" After decades of bloody battles, the remains of mechas and insect limbs turned into dense debris strewn throughout Glamoth's segmentum, connecting with each other to form a \"River of Death.\" When the remnants of the Swarm no longer posed a threat and the leaders of the council rang the bell of peace, informing the citizens that they had dispelled the apocalypse that clouded the heavens and the republic would be ushered back into the light of day — What arrived was not daylight, but the beginning of another sunless night.\\n\\nAfter that, the civilization known as Glamoth faded away, and the long-awaited peace came to the empty stars. The long river of stardust and debris flows silently along the void."

			"The attendants bow and salute with uniform smiles, and greet the guests with music: \"Welcome to the Planet of Festivities! Beautiful dreams await you.\" The guests smile as they move forward, accepting their drinks infused full of bubbles and gulping them down.\\n\\nThe scenery gradually becomes more and more incredulous, and the senses feel as if one has been lifted by silk. Guests from other lands defy gravity and walk on walls. Strange toys come to life and roam the streets in celebration. The water from the spring turn into a giant whale and swim through the halls. Opening a window no longer show a view of the stars in the deep sky, but of the city's shifting streams of light and shadows, holding up the constant echoes of giant clocks and theaters. The guests finally realize that they were never awake, but are instead witnessing Penacony's true nature in a dream — a place where time stops in a neverending dreamscape.\\n\\nEveryone knows that, under the rule of \"The Family,\" the doors of Penacony are open to everyone amidst the stars. For a transcendent experience, for an inspirational excitement, for the soothing of worries and wounds — guests of the highest caliber come to surrender their pain in exchange for peace and tranquility, to drink the best of the best, and to wander in the sea of dreams. Some spend unforgettable holidays here and leave content, while others become obsessed with the festivities and settle down here. The star-studded hotel is the jewel of dream weavers, the kingdom of dream makers, and the playground of dream seekers.\\n\\nFew guests are aware of the dusty history of the past — the thread that weaves the dreams comes from reality. The velvety splendor of today's Penacony was born of salty rust, heavy shackles, and deprived freedom. The Planet of Festivities was once an IPC prison, where countless inmates were relocated to salvage the overflowing Memory Bubbles for the Garden of Recollection. People repeated their endless toils until their bodies were as heavy as lead, but their souls became as light as bubbles. At some unknown point in time, the small cells cut off access to reality, but people's consciousnesses became linked in dreams. In the midnight bell, that shared dream seemed so real, reflecting the sheer hypocrisy of reality.\\n\\nIt lasted until the Destruction melted the chains of the IPC, the Trailblaze connected this frontier to the other stars, and the Harmony arrived upon invitation to sow the seeds of peace. Freedom finally broke ground and added a new name to the original dream — Penacony.\\n\\nToday, there is no trace of the crumbling prison. In the dream world, a myriad of skyscrapers has been erected and the desert has been rebuilt and transformed into a metropolis — a new world for dreamers in search of wealth and opportunities, and a utopia for those in search of indulgence and pleasure. The past of the Planet of Festivities is like a photo that fell to the bottom of a cupboard — it exists, but is seen by no one.\\n\\nNowadays, the land of dreams is filled with songs of joy, and the noise of the past have been relegated to gossip, silently lost in the interlude of a comedy, in the behind-the-scenes of some cartoon, or in the side column of some magazine."

			"Those who have visited Penacony will agree that \"built on dreams\" is not just some saying, but is a very real statement. The opulent hotel is just the tip of the iceberg of the Planet of Festivities, and it is only when you \"stay and dream\" that you are considered to have officially arrived at Penacony. From then on, the land of dreams, consisting of twelve dreamscapes, slowly expands before the guests' eyes.\\n\\nGuests who are new to the place may be overwhelmed by this carnival stage, but do not be alarmed. Look up and see the metal tracks crisscrossing the skyscrapers and the Spheroids rapidly rolling along them. They are the most visible means of transportation in this dreamscape metropolis and guide guests to each and every place around the city.\\n\\nStarting from the central station, the complicated Spheroid tracks are like the blood vessels of the metropolis. Whether it is the underground tunnels of the Moment of Daybreak, the vast fields of the Moment of Scorchsand, or the glittering stadium of the Moment of Stars, the colorful Spheroids roll on and on, delivering people to each station accurately, efficiently, safely, and comfortably, pouring a sleepless energy into the dream world of Penacony.\\n\\nDreams give a light and delicate texture to everything, and the nut-like Spheroids are regarded as both vehicles and as toys in the land of dreams. However, few remember that the Spheroids are actually imprisonment cages — the vehicle towards dreams are tools originally used for locking up prisoners.\\n\\nA long time ago, the IPC sent a huge number of prisoners to the Asdana star system in an attempt to stop a catastrophe from spreading. There, people reclaimed memoria, gradually becoming lost between fantasy and reality. The spherical work chambers in vacuum became an unforgettable \"memory\" for the prisoners — the hard curved interior walls, the awful experience of tumbling around, the unbearable daily attendance — perhaps these pains ran too deep. When those who regained their freedom pioneered the barren dreamscape, the spherical cages came along with them.\\n\\nBut now, unlike in the past, peace and freedom have given birth to optimism. Instead of trying to destroy the inescapable nightmares over and over, it is better to add to them the color this place should have, to take them in, and embrace them. So, the spherical imprisonment cages of the past have become today's Spheroids.\\n\\nIn the present, the fast-moving colorful Spheroids moving all over Penacony and the slight reverberations coming from within them... are all quietly hidden in the light of the dream city, blending in with the ambitions and laughter, like a land of dreams where time forever stands still."

Within just two years, this young fanatic conquered the bitter cold, pestilence, and death, and managed to address three major longstanding issues that had plagued the Department for several Amber Eras. One of these challenges is the desolate planet known as Sigonia-IV, which is covered in barren deserts and scarred by clan vendettas... a place of harsh conditions and strife.\\n\\nSituated near the convergence of three major star clusters, Sigonia-IV has long been subjected to stellar winds from multiple stars, earning its reputation as the \"eye of the storm\" throughout the Cosmos. The planet's surface environment is extremely harsh, leading many civilizations to either migrate to other celestial bodies or succumb to natural disasters. Now, only a small number of intelligent races remain there, referred to as Sigonians by scholars from the Intelligentsia Guild.\\n\\nIn reality, Sigonians have fragmented into numerous clans, with most adopting nomadic lifestyles, while a few have established centralized systems of governance of reasonable size.\\n\\nThey share a common language. Through the translation provided by the Synesthesia Beacon, you will learn that \"Katica\" means \"shellslasher,\" who have a reputation of being the most ferocious clan among Sigonians. And \"Avgin\" means \"honey,\" who are often accused of pilfering by those willfully ignorant. These clans share a vendetta that lasted through Amber Eras, engaged in a cycle of bloody vengeance in the boundless wilderness where only the fittest survive — until mysterious figures clad in black descended from the sky. From there, Sigonians were briefly united under the radiance of Amber, and the natural cycles that were finally reached a temporary conclusion.\\n\\nAfterward, under the IPC's guidance, the Sigonians established the Sigonian Sovereignty according to the Interstellar Peace Charter and took their first steps toward the wider Cosmos.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this unity and progress did not extend to the Avgins and Katicans. Some malicious opportunists among the Sigonians viewed the former's resourcefulness with suspicion, while slandering the latter as nothing more than predators with no hope of enlightenment. Although they possessed only limited knowledge about Preservation, they understood that some of them had to be sacrificed for it. Utilizing a highly advanced set of parliamentary rules, these devious and corrupt individuals banished both clans to the endless desert.\\n\\nAs a token of apology, they even went out of their way to declare that \"the Avgins shall forever retain the right to autonomy\" — In other words, should any future conflicts occur between the two clans, they could justifiably and lawfully sit back and do nothing."

However, these inborn talents are the exact reason they draw jealousy and ire from others. And the envious and snobbish soon begin their ceaseless slander, and the baseless defamation of the Avgins thus spreads like wildfire throughout the cosmos. As mere rumors can suffice to tarnish the sanctity of truth, the Avgins, a people of a peripheral world, found themselves assailed without recourse, subject to all manners of suspicion and prejudice.\\n\\nThe Avgins have an appreciation for intricately patterned fabrics, as well as a penchant for jewelry crafted from precious gemstones. They're particularly fond of turquoise meteorites, the only kind of gemstones capable of rivaling the resplendence of Gaiathra Triclops' divine body, which in their mythology is believed to have been reborn from death.\\n\\nKnown as Fenge Biyos, their Mother Goddess reigns over all matters related to fertility, travels, and trickery. Depictions of the Mother Goddess in the Avgins' religion often portray her as a left palm adorned with three eyes. The Avgins primarily express reverence for her through spoken prayers alone, believing that the Mother Goddess is as silent and unassuming as the mountains of Sigonia, and that crafting statues or composing hymns for her would only distance themselves from her protective embrace.\\n\\nThe Avgins view the world through the body of the Mother Goddess — the earth, the mountains, and all that exists on the land are a part of the Mother Goddess' divine body. And at the end of each calendar year, her divine body will perish.\\n\\nOn that significant day, her divine essence ascends as a resplendent aurora in the night sky and is reborn in the following day. Hence, Avgins celebrate the first day of the new year through their grand festival called \"Kakava.\" During this festival, they weave sacrificial vessels known as \"Knots of Cyclicality\" and toss them into bonfires to commemorate the Great Goddess' birth.\\n\\nAccording to the incident report by the Marketing Development Department, that shocking conflict took place on a night of Kakava. It was a stormy night when the clouds and fog engulfed the northern lights, which should have been seen as an ill omen. However, the Avgin people were unexpectedly excited. When questioned about this, a maiden from the clan provided the following response.\\n\\n\"Rain is a gift from the Mother Goddess. She is calling to us, urging us to take up arms and fight for our future.\"\\n\"This rain accompanies us. This rain protects us. It is in this rain that we shall meet our honorable demise.\""

Those who looked down named the land below \"Izumo.\" Those who looked up named the world above \"Takamagahara.\" One day uninscribed in the annals, the Yaoyorozu no Kami descended from Takamagahara. These demonic beasts named Kami overturned the skies, burned the rivers and oceans, and shattered the land — People realized in horror that it was not an invasion for rulership, dominance, or plunder. The evil Kami came only to kill.\\n\\nAs the planet stood on the brink of death, Izumo embarked on a Kami-slaying journey, exhausting the might of the entire country to slay the calamity named \"Sovereign of Revelation\" and forging the very first Edict Edge using its bestial body. Giving the Kami a taste of their own medicine, the wielder of these swords can recite the mantra contained within the blade to master the divine power of Takamagahara, and use it to combat the evil Kami and save the masses. From then on, Izumo started its long and arduous crusade, exchanging inordinate lives lost for the fall of one Kami after another, shattering countless mortal blades to forge the twelve Sentinels.\\n\\nIn the merciless fight for survival, Izumo used the might of the Edict Edges to light up their uncivilized world of darkness in less than ten Amber Eras, building cities of dazzling neon lights. That distant Takama Divine Realm, once so far away, became so close within their reach — Yet history suddenly stopped there. The existence of the two planets instantly evaporated, disappearing into nothingness.\\n\\nNowadays, the past of the border planet Izumo can only be gleaned from the scattered whispers in the universe. Academics hold various views regarding its disappearance, but none can solve the mystery. Izumo's history should have been a long flowing river, but it was severed in one cut, and all its past and future voided on emptiness' other shore. Did it never exist, and was it no more than a fabricated story? Did its histories never occur, and it ran aground on the beach of reverse causation? Was it yet another appalling experiment by Dr. Primitive, or was it a sign of the Voracity returning from the end of the Cosmos?\\n\\nOnly that pitch-black great sun knows the answer, yet THEY remain silent, never speaking.\\n\\nBecause everything that had happened will one day regress to the end, and everything that had ended is guaranteed to happen again.

			"The beginning of ancient foxian and borisin ballads all nostalgically sing of the \"Planet of Verdantia\" and its fertile soil and pleasant climate. However, upon closer inspection, the perceptive ones will realize such words are mere preludes to the eternal theme of \"war.\"\\n\\nWith their talents for agriculture and commerce, some fox clans built prosperous towns next to flowing rivers. Meanwhile, the children of wolves roamed with their herd under the aurora-covered sky within the lush grasslands, forming settlements that dotted the landscape. The merchants laughed at the herders for the latter's savagery, while the herders despised the merchants for their deception. However, they both must confront the cruel torments of nature — the \"Vulpesummer\" and \"Lupuswinter.\"\\n\\nIn the summer of rich harvests blessed by the fox deity, the two clans put down their arms and ceased warfare in mutual satisfaction. But once the wolf deity lets fall the white frost, the snowlines would spread from the poles and hunger shall drive the two clans to unceasing conflict.\\n\\nThe ballads mention that the Lupuswinter once stayed far beyond its due, even after the sun of Verdantia had circled the planet thirty-three times. Poverty and hunger crashed the people, and they resorted to even eating animals they once worshipped as totems. After foreseeing the end where the entire world shall be covered in bleak death, a savior climbed to the peak of the tallest mountain in that world — The foxian legends called her \"Tushan,\" but the borisin sagas called him \"Duran.\" No matter what this savior was called, they made a wish to the Master of Immortality, hoping for sustenance enough to keep the world's people alive. Then, the mountains split, and sweet divine nectar of Redspring poured out from the hilly ravines.\\n\\nThose who drank from the Redspring obtained power, dexterity, and strength from the beast meat they devoured. Their blood, too, stirred with the ferocity of animals, and their bodily forms became increasingly bestial — Thus was this world changed, never to return to its former days.\\n\\nWith the Redspring as the medium, everything that the reborn canine races needed was made from this miraculous source — The fields no longer grew grain but viscorpi instead, and the garments that covered people's bodies were no longer of linen but of embryonic flesh. Even the chilly snowlands that once terrified the Verdantia civilizations were no longer a concern, for the canine races cultivated biological membranes in the polar regions to craft into warm dome-shaped tents, blocking the impoverished Lupuswinter beyond this barrier.\\n\\nThen, things changed in the Planet of Verdantia, just like how things changed for every short-life species that became long-life — There was population explosion, ecological collapse, internal warfare... And no matter how hard the canine races prayed to the Master of Immortality, they never heard another reply. Then, the people understood the truth: Everything that the Master of Immortality could give had been given, and if the people wished to have better lives, they must take more by themselves.\\n\\nGathered around Duran the great Brood Lord, the canine races cast their sight into the sky where the Master of Immortality dwelled. The stars sparkled like a grassland waiting to be conquered with fast steads, and they will bring the \"Lupuswinter\" to the civilizations on those planets.\\n\\nMuch later, their sworn enemies dubbed them \"borisin,\" for it signified \"wolf\" in the vernacular of Verdantia."

This blank bridle would become a book that records the history of their battles throughout their lives.\\n\\nAs soon as the adulthood ceremony ends, the borisin youths must walk into the weapon farm, then pick and tame their first battle mount among the \"mechabeasts\" that have been filtered and bred via gene witchcraft. Mechabeasts that consume the conquered as their feed have astounding agility, perception, and ferocity — Yet they are considered mere sheep when facing against their future masters. As the moonlight stirs the violent blood in their veins, the borisin youths chase and duel against the mechabeasts. Some will die from the beast's kiss — That is the result of cowardice. Some will kill their peers — That is the law of how valiant beasts shall be distributed... The borisin youths trip the desired mount to the ground and tie the bridle, which is inlaid with neural spike whips, onto the animal's neck — The beast will be stunned through telepathy with its future master and become as tame as if they already received hundreds of whiplashes. When the beast willingly carries the master on its back, a fitting borisin sorya (warrior, rider) will have been born.\\n\\nThen, the borisin bridle will become the recorder of wars, and the reins will gradually become full of scratches, knots, and accessories.\\n\\nThe well-trained sorya dons jellyfish-like membranous armor under the leadership of a yonda (leader, centurion). They then board the beast ships that can warp between stars, explore different worlds, and swear in the name of Duran and the Master of Immortality to make the stars into their herding ground. On the bridle, light scratches indicate how many enemies the owner had slain, knots record how many major campaigns they were involved in, and the accessories dangling from the reins are loot such as human teeth and Intellitron cores obtained from pillaging frenzies... They are the vengeful wails of the conquered, as well as medals for borisin individuals to demonstrate their strength.\\n\\nWhen the mounts beneath the warrior perish in warfare, or when borisin wish to mete out punishment, the bridle can also be fastened around the bodies of other living beings.\\n\\nTheir targets are usually foxians — The slave race excluded from the clan due to genetic selection plans. They are weak, devious, and are only fit for lowly labor and calculations. Whenever rare war-like individuals emerge among the foxians, the master of the wolf-head would prioritize binding these foxians with the bridles, driving them as war slaves to serve as vanguards on the battlefield.\\n\\nIf all slaves are dead, and the weapons are bent, then the bridle can still act as a whip if one attaches a spike to the end. If the bridle is snapped and the warrior perishes in war with their fangs and claws shattered, then the bridle will become the sole remaining epitaph and memories for borisin...\\n\\nJust as the old tales said that \"the position between the predator and prey often changes in the forest,\" countless wolf-kind bridles have been broken and snapped after fighting for millennia against the Xianzhou in this dark forest called the universe. In the end, this link that connects various clans is severed by the sharp arrow of The Hunt, and the borisin also fall into the shadow of internal strife and general decay, becoming ever more removed from their former pride."

			"The Xianzhou Zhuming had floated in the starry seas for over eight millennia after setting sail from the Primeval Imperium. If one were able to view a chronological snapshot of how the starship's form had changed, it would be a very romantic experience — The colossal ship swallowed a deep-blue star, peeled off the worn hull layer by layer, swelled as a brimming bud, and finally bloomed into a lotus.\\n\\nFrom space, the entire Xianzhou Zhuming appears as a lotus lantern of filigree gold. The giant glowing \"lotus leaves\" gradually spread out around the \"light poles\" and are bathed in a soft blue glow, being indeed worthy of poems that declare it \"A ship whose hull deceives the eyes, a lotus whose petals like candles glow.\" The \"lampstand\" section at the center of the ship is a spherical cage, its size on the magnitude of a celestial object. It tightly wraps around the azure sun, the \"lantern wick,\" and eternally spins. This mega structure is the most important location for the Xianzhou Zhuming's manufacturing industry — the Flamewheel Forge.\\n\\nIn the past, the Zhuming Grand Artisan Yang Di had received a weapon mold from the anonymous sovereign of the Primeval Imperium as a gift when the fleet set off on their voyage. Thousands of years later, though the fleet has now changed beyond recognition with their immortality and the return voyage will never occur, the tradition of the Grand Artisan never died. In the Xianzhou Zhuming, artisanship is the supreme school of learning. All its generals also held the title of the Artisanship Commission's Furnace Master. When they leave the ship, they command thousands of troops. When they return to the ship, they would swing their hammer and forge wondrous items, and receive the people's supreme respect. More than half of the weapons used in the Xianzhou's hunts throughout the fleet's history were forged in the Xianzhou Zhuming. Therefore, the Flamewheel Forge came to be regarded as the holy pilgrimage site for such technologies in the entire Cosmos.\\n\\nMetalsmithing is a measure of the advance of civilizations, while flames mark the beginning of civilizations. Many civilizations, while in their infancy, are most troubled with the problem of energy sources. The people would spare no effort in discovering energy sources that can support their civilization to new heights. The Xianzhou Zhuming have stepped over this limitation — By imprisoning the progenitor of heliobi, the Flint Emperor, the artisans have obtained a literally inexhaustible power source. The Flamewheel Forge has intricate branch-like track systems that cover the star as much as possible, and the delicate boughs and leaves are choked with receptors and transmitters that guide the Primordial Flame \"Flint Emperor\" to provide energy for all technological developments.\\n\\nCountless artisans regard the Zhuming Artisanship Commission, which had swallowed up a Pseudo Sun, as the hallowed hall of the craft, with apprentices who aspire to forge divine tools swarming the institution. With enough force, anything can be crafted, and the Flamewheel Forge has prepared everything the artisans could possibly need —\\n\\nApprentices from different worlds come together before the Forge and become fellow students, then compete and share their skills. Outworlders who come in search of marvelous tools would also pay a hefty sum to commission artisans to craft otherworldly items — However, the countless apprentices over the millennia have rarely been favored by General Huaiyan, the \"Artisan of Artisans.\" Whenever he tutors students himself and personally passes on his skills both as a craftsman and a soldier, these students would either become grandmasters who leave a mark in the annals as Furnace Masters or become Cloud Knights with names that thunder through the Alliance such as the Flamewheel Octet.\\n\\n\"Forges wrought a million stars bright, irons craft heroes' soaring flight. Miniscule lights into martial might made, only with sharp blades are peace and plenty saved.\" From the day a Zhuming artisan receives their tools, they must always remember — What they will spend their days and nights making are no simple weapons, but the arrows carrying the creed of The Hunt."

			"The Xianzhou Zhuming has always been accompanied by multicolored light bands while voyaging in deep space. These bands are both energy outputs from super-high-temperature fusion reactions, as well as evidence that the Flint Emperor still burns and shall never die.\\n\\nOn the outermost skirts of the aurora-inducing particles dispersed with the Flint Emperor's breaths, newborn heliobi slow down and wander into being. The Flamehunt Judges of the Zhuming Ten-Lords Commission then capture these naive heliobi that have not had any contact with emotions, using kind and gentle dreams to tame the immature temperaments of such flames. Then, the judges pass these harmless heliobi to the Artisanship Commission's Temperaflame Office, which matches the heliobi with various artifacts to make them into lamps, vehicles, and various spectacles in Zhuming... However, in the eyes of confused outworlders, these talking and walking items are proof of the rumor that \"divine essence exists everywhere in the delves, and items would become demons once they are old enough\"...\\n\\nFollowing the alien-colored light band, one can walk deeper past the Forge and arrive at the hypergravity field created by the Pseudo Sun. Mortals struggle to endure a stellar density of this degree. It is an inwardly collapsing disorder that only Ribhus artisans can traverse with ease.\\n\\nThe scorching stellar surges and abnormal celestial phenomena prevent the curious from continuing to approach the Pseudo Sun. All fundamental physical laws of the universe have been amplified in this space. Only one stout and powerful stellar race, the Ribhus, can survive in spaces with such gravitational abnormalities — The Ribhus are natural-born elite artisans. They pass between the Forge and the Pseudo Sun, and their perception of time has long strayed from that of normal beings. They keep their promise and continue to improve their artisanship, forging the ship's enormous cannons and keeping watch over the Pseudo Sun's slumber. The Xianzhou Zhuming regards Ribhus as loyal allies, respecting their tenacity and strength, while being grateful for their selfless sacrifice.\\n\\nAnd yet, no being can follow the light bands further across the outlandish and twisted gravity field to dive deep into the Pseudo Sun. That is a place forbidden to all beings capable of emotion, a room where the endless dream of the Flint Emperor floats — The Xianzhou Zhuming is always on watch, for even the smallest sliver of emotional disturbances can awaken the boundless might of the heliobi progenitor.\\n\\nThere are frequently individuals who ignore the warning and cast their gaze upon the Pseudo Sun from afar. They would unknowingly slip into the psychological gravitational field, and their smallest carelessness would result in their sentience being taken away by the torrential mirages that pour out like a tide. Different from interacting with the gentle illusions, staring upon that \"azure sun\" would only make one feel the boundless rage that has been suppressed since the beginning of time — \"The heliobi shall give the heroes enough power to scorch the very heavens, but when all duties have been fulfilled, the heroes must give to the heliobi supreme bodies forged into perfection...\" No one knows how this ancient oath could be fulfilled. Similarly, none knows when the Flint Emperor would awaken from its bottomless dream.\\n\\nDeep within the lotus lantern's wick, the Pseudo Sun heaves a profound sigh in its unending sleep. The Xianzhou ship slowly sails across the sky, leaving behind only an iridescent trail. In this way, the Xianzhou Zhuming will continue to ally with fire, journey with fire, and share its destiny with that of the fire."

			"Among the multitude of planets with a dearth of liquid water, the pure blue of Lushaka shines prominently among the Przesmir star system. Her seawater resembles the cradle of the mother of oceans. The water nurtures and sustains all life... yet also entraps them, controls them, and ensnares them until there is no more escape.\\n\\nAt the break of dawn, the first mate of the \"stateship\" gently knocks on the Captain's quarters door, and pushes it open. The island ecologies of the Old Era's thirty-seven domains are stuck on the walls all over the cabin. That is how people miss land — meteors from beyond the skies are in the process of covering the entirety of Lushaka with water as if following some single-minded wish. Unending tides bury all ancestral lands in abyssal waters, leaving only an expanse of blue... The first mate rouses the sleeping Captain, for the sea is already glinting specks of gold — the \"stateship\" has begun another day's voyage.\\n\\nThe scouting ship arrives at the center of the plaza. It fires its anchor arrow towards a massive underwater structure that was once a shopping mall. The anchor firmly lodges itself on a window frame — before the diving bell comes, countless startled schools of fish surge forth from the shopping mall's shelves.\\n\\nAfter midday, the scholars leave from the diving bell. They swim past the bookstore, not stopping even for a second — after all, the ink would have long been blurred beyond recognition. Their goal has always been those mediums of shellac or plastic, from which information of past days can be easily obtained after easy cleanup. Deepsea archaeology like this is always arduous. The cleaners stand their ground and watch the vicinity alertly, steel halberds swinging, ensuring that toothy predators are kept at bay. The humans will occasionally collide with deepwater aqua sprites, but both parties are too engrossed in their respective scavenging to pay each other any heed. Instead of shriveled cans, the cleaners are more invested in finding seeds, spices, or liquor.\\n\\nThe intensive underwater investigation is nearing its end as the oxygen reserves decline. Looking back underwater, the giant mackerels have already reached the city. The anxious aqua sprites immediately hold their breath, hug the wall, or hide in secret chambers. They have grown used to utilizing the underwater steel forest.\\n\\nThe drizzle lets up as the sun starts to sink, and the various stateships sound their horns to scatter the plundering seabirds around them. They place the day's harvest on the deck for the stateship's citizens to take what they need. Currents surge at night as the light tower shines crystalline bright. The Luvians dance around the flaming mast, forgetting the tomorrow that will inevitably come, recounting the glories of today with sea shanties, and sighing softly to the halcyon past with medleys. The Captain takes out his compass, gazing toward the direction it points — he knows in that direction lies their home that is growing ever more unfamiliar, where there are still people longing for the return of their kin.\\n\\nAt midnight, the colossal ship extinguishes all its lights, silently adrift upon the sea. Have they truly found peace? Or are their smiles masking the tears that have long dissolved into the sea?\\n\\nAfter tonight, this deep blue will remain unchanged, as it always has."

After all, things that were once above the water have long been submerged in this deep blue.\\n\\nThe land-dwellers of Lushaka have an intimate yet unfamiliar relationship with the aqua sprites. In deepsea investigations, the land-dwellers view encounters with the aqua sprites as lucky omens, describing the spirits as beautiful and mysterious creatures. Aqua sprites possess navy blue wing membranes and onyx eyes, as well as unique vocal cords capable of producing ethereal sounds. According to stories passed down by mouth among the deepsea investigators, these creatures often accompany sea dragons and reside in a silvery city deep underwater — they exist between reality and legend, embodying serenity and liveliness.\\n\\nHowever, the language used to describe them in the ocean-drowned past was — Edars, monsters of the deep sea.\\n\\nLong ago, the Edars and the land-dwellers fiercely vied for survival. No one could ignore the vivid red the oceans were dyed into. Initially, juvenile Edars were regarded as mere fishing catches. Then, the land-dwellers were lured into the ocean to drown by the songs of the Edars. Both races were hunters and prey for the other in the vast waters. Then came clashes between blades and anchors, as well as battles between sea beasts and cannons. The relentless war, both above and below the water's surface, persisted until the reefs shattered under scorching magma.

She thought she could rely on her quick reactions for an easy win, but the old lady got near her in three strides and landed a blow straight to her face. When Lindsay regained consciousness, she picked up the boxing headgear she had tossed aside. Through the narrow opening of the headgear, she saw a brand-new world.\\n\\n\"So, these are the fists of a true boxer, huh? Interesting. If you want teach me, then train me to be the strongest boxer that ever lived.\"\\n\\nThough a bit begrudgingly, Lindsay accepted that she had lost the bet. Now, wearing protective equipment for the first time, she officially stepped into the world of boxing."

Another reason, however, was that when red sand filled the air and blocked out the sun, it provided them with a prime opportunity to ambush the encampments of other bandit groups, as they could put on breathing masks and pop up out of nowhere among the sweeping sandstorms.\\n\\nA cohort of prepared bandits attacking another cohort of unprepared bandits — such is the law of survival in Talia.\\n\\nThis sandstorm mask looks like a hassle to put on and remove.

			"\"...Birds are born with no shackles, then what fetters my fate♬?\"\\n\\nOn rehearsal day, the young family head hides in a corner of the audience seats, refraining from distracting the singer on the stage and maintaining the right distance, just as he had wished. He sits upright in his ceremonial garb as the solitary listener for that moment. Amidst the familiar melodies, his thoughts drift back to his childhood, recalling occasions when she sang on stage, and he was her only audience —\\n\\n\"It's been so long since you sang with joy... I've built a stage for you, though it's... a bit rudimentary.\"\\n\\nDuring the concert for the two of them, he vowed to fulfill her dream of gracing a grander, brighter stage someday.\\n\\n\"Let my heart bravely spread the wings. Soaring past the night. To trace the bright moonlight...♬\"\\n\\nHe snaps out of his trance, then faces the root of his reluctance to draw nearer to the stage — His ceremonial garb is not just for enjoying the performance, but for the chance to withdraw at any moment he pleased.\\n\\n\"Congratulations, sister. We have both achieved our aspirations,\" he softly utters."

Countless in quantity, they were difficult to store, and she couldn't be bothered to manage them herself.\\n\\nThe generous and charitable Interastral Peace Corporation then proposed a solution and that was how the Herta Space Station, where wisdom and secrets are stored, was born. Comprehensive containment measures were made throughout the space station, all in the pursuit of organizing everything in the collection with order and clarity. Phenomena were stored in specialized containers while Curios were regulated in indices. Innumerable items were categorized and classified, then stored deep within the station for research.\\n\\nThe IPC then proposed a collaboration in exploring the secrets of the stars together, which brought curious and adventurous scholars into the station to conduct research.\\n\\nMost of them admired Madam Herta, vowing to never abandon their ethereal aspirations and explore the secrets whispered among the stars. They investigated the star systems and realms of living beings, debated true justice in discourses on ethics and philosophies, outlined valleys and peaks within galaxies, deciphered secrets behind religious rituals and ceremonies, held on to the way of seeking truth from practice... They were the true believers of passing knowledge to posterity, and practiced unrestrained and divergent research.\\n\\nHowever, once the space station moved into orbit, it started to operate on its own and Madam Herta rarely showed herself. It was then that the IPC realized the whole station was filled with the mundane daily activities of the researchers, yet the genius was nowhere to be seen.\\n\\nLight from different zones rendered people unaware of the passage of time, the traces of which could only be detected in the burnt out lifestyle in the station. Often a smattering of researchers would argue non-stop about a particular piece of collection, even going so far as to start a fight. Occasionally a security officer would be absent from their daily patrol and nap instead on their military-styled bunker. Sometimes senior researchers would share with their younger peers tales of past romances, while some big shots would disguise themselves as temporary workers to bid their time for the next big turn of luck... Besides research, there was also life. They just had to look outside the hull — for the stars were journeying with them.\\n\\nDespite all the limitations, the researchers still talked about the everyday life in the space station in their own romantic way — The cosmos was a profound epic poem, and Herta Space Station was slowly cracking open the poetry collection."

The station could immediately fall into disaster if she ever had a wild idea. Curios that simulate a stellar collapse, a distorted gravitational field caused by the collision of dark galaxies... Madam Herta collected them all when she was in the mood, but would often lose interest once she got her hands on them.\\n\\nHence, though the space station appears to be floating peacefully in space, its treasure hoard of multi-shaped crises hung above it like a sword waiting to fall.\\n\\nSenior researchers had long been aware of the dangers they faced, and understood that \"secrets lie deep within danger.\" They strictly adhere to confidentiality agreements and faithfully carry out regulated containment procedures, thus burying danger within an outward silence... In the cafeteria, they were friends who could joke around. Yet, deep in the bowels of the space station's storage zones, they were highly skilled experts. In this place, secrets would always remain secrets.\\n\\nThe space station is operating as usual in low orbit around The Blue.

In this lonely voyage, people slumbered, woke up, and slumbered again in incessant alternation... Star-chasing whales fell from the dome of heaven, and crystalline entities made of subgrain lattice managed to span light years without a single crack. The Elixir Seekers witnessed the majesty of various supernatural powers. In covert delight, they further hardened their resolve to obtain immortality.\\n\\nAfter voyaging for thousands of years, the Xianzhou Luofu gradually came to a halt, whereupon it encountered the master of Abundance in the limbo between the reality and the imaginary. Yaoshi bestowed a divine miracle upon the ship, and it immediately manifested as the Ambrosial Arbor. Its shade was as large as clouds, blocking out the sky and sun. Its roots were thick and dense, enveloping the entire Xianzhou ship — the Luofu seemed to be brought to life.\\n\\nThose who coveted immortality swallowed the fruit of the Ambrosial Arbor, and finally obtained the Endless Lifespan they had dreamed so much about. The Xianzhou residents began to claim they were celestial beings worthy of endless lifespans in abundance, and they also learned to use the Ambrosial Arbor to create various inhuman marvels via the blessings of immortality.\\n\\nYet, just like the shifting of the sun and moon, what once prospered was fated to decline and what once brought elation must eventually induce agony. It was not until the arrival of the Three Sufferings, when people were tormented to near extinction, that the Xianzhou people finally came to understand the true nature of this so-called miracle, which was nothing but harrowing calamity.\\n\\nIn the midst of disaster, a hero rose with the Reignbow and split the Ambrosial Arbor in half. The Xianzhou people regained their dignity as humans, and vowed to return to mortality and purge all deathless doom in this universe. In the ensuing years, Xianzhou went on a hunt across the stellar seas, taking it upon themselves to purge all deathless abominations. The foxians regained their freedom and took back control of the sky, while the Vidyadhara sealed off the contamination and any residual catastrophes. The three races were then brought together in a covenant and coalition. Thus was born the Xianzhou Alliance.\\n\\nProsperity and calamity came and went in cycles during the voyage. Heroes and legends rose to fame and glory one after another as history marched on. Now, the Xianzhou Luofu is healing and reconstructing in a period of hard-won peace. Free trade and open minds truly brought it back to life.\\n\\nImmortality had permanently molded the Xianzhou Luofu. With its ups and downs through history, the Xianzhou Luofu accumulated its own unique aura that combined both antiquity and modernity.

From that moment, the ancient taboos and laws were rendered useless, and nature's dictum and ethics regarding aging and death became irrelevant history. People followed the way of immortality to exploit the Ambrosial Arbor with increasing intensity, making Fallow Earth that never exhausted itself, molding their own bodies to shapeshift, and giving the gift of thinking and talking to animals... Innumerable unimaginable technologies were brought into existence under the branches of the Ambrosial Arbor.\\n\\nHowever, the Ambrosial Arbor took off its disguise as time went by, revealing its hideous visage as the agony of immortality crept upon the immortals.\\n\\nThe celestials ceaselessly reproduced, yet tasted no death. The ship groaned from overpopulation, as hunger and starvation tormented many. Xianzhou's young can never realize their life's ambitions while their elders clang to power, and society teetered at the edge of structural collapse... Rebellions of the aurumatons and external invasions marked a ruinous millennium, after which the darkness hidden in immortal bloodlines also showed its face. The so-called \"Body of Celestials\" was simply a technology that surpassed human intellect. The propensity to be stricken with mara was a warning to all Xianzhou natives, a reminder that they were a mere step away from becoming abominations themselves.\\n\\nIn desperation, a hero tore through the sky with a powerful shot from their bow, splitting the Ambrosial Arbor in half... Yet even if all there was left of the Ambrosial Arbor was a burnt stump, the fate of Xianzhou could never be separated from it.\\n\\nIt attracted external forces to invade Xianzhou. The Abominations of Abundance launched multitudes of assaults, where flesh was distorted and blood was spilled, for the sole purpose of devouring Xianzhou whole. The Arbor also tempted the Xianzhou residents. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus broke the taboos and ventured deep into the secret of Abundance within the Ambrosial Arbor, hoping to reforge the once mighty immortal empire... In the long days of foreign and domestic troubles, the remaining corpus of the Ambrosial Arbor lurked like unending vines propagating in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to wreak havoc again.\\n\\nFortunately, the Xianzhou Luofu never lowered its guard against the withered tree.

In order to fully carry out their devotion, they turned their sights to deep space.\\n\\nLouis Fleming raised a call for action, and the long-distance trade fleet left the star systems adjacent to Aeon Qlipoth. Their commodities were no longer limited to building materials... They plan to connect the whole Cosmos and trade everything. Soon after, Dongfang Qixing implemented Cosmos-wide trade regulations and built a \"credit\" system to set a price for everything across the universe. Trillions of assets gathered under their megastructure on Pier Point. Like a silent black hole, the building destroyed people's notions about the limits of wealth.\\n\\nToday, the ships of the Interastral Peace Corporation are all over the Cosmos. Despite being criticized as a corporate dictatorship, the IPC has not stopped expanding. They don't care what other people think and have never forgotten their founding mission.\\n\\nThe IPC's recruit training methods change with each passing day, but after nearly eight hundred Amber Eras, there is only one historical practice that never changed. Once upon a time, Louis Fleming, the founder of the IPC, stood in front of the support team and made a passionate speech. He put forward the aspiration of uniting the universe and supporting the Aeon's wishes to protect the universe. As soon as the speech ended, the distant and huge sound of a cosmic impact sounded, injecting a lofty calling into this solemn and sublime moment. From that moment on, they knew this would become their unswerving belief.\\n\\n\"All for the Amber Lord.\""

The Aeon Qlipoth has no intention of accepting these eager gifts, instead always solely focused on the crisis that will befall the unsuspecting mortals, having to cast the gargantuan barriers measured in light years.

			"Regarding the origin of mechanical life, the carbon-based scholars of the Intelligentsia Guild have a unique speculation: A cluster of electrons born by chance.\\n\\nElectric currents flow throughout the atmosphere and ground. It separated into secondary forms of different magnitudes under the countless acts of gravity and repulsive forces. According to the scholars' hypothesis, this action is tantamount to cell division in carbon-based life. Thereafter, currents randomly output different potentials via the transistor structure naturally formed on the planetary surface, creating the most primitive program. The proud scholars argued that in this way, machines have \"thoughts\" that are comparable to carbon-based life.\\n\\nA mechanic objected to this: How can carbon-based life, which has not even been able to understand the origin of their own beings, have the gall to spout such fallacies? As soon as the words came out, the academic world of the universe was shaken to the core. Mechanical life began to re-examine the arrogant \"carbon-based centrism\" and examine its own origin.\\n\\nHowever, the Screwllumites on the Planet Screwllum had no choice but to pause their march — their planet's energy was being exhausted faster than their inspiration circuits. They needed to first find a way for their population to survive.\\n\\nIn the end, they decided to carry out an extreme plan that transcended several Amber Eras: They used the dying planet as fuel to power the Celestial Differentiator. The awe-inspiring, gigantic gear tirelessly processed the punched tape, methodically repeating calculations. With its planetary energy supply, the huge machine simulated a bona fide and stable superecosystem. They would then build their new home around this parent star.\\n\\nWith their planetary crisis lifted, the Screwllumites could rest. Always rational, optimistic, and elegant, they are determined to explore the answer to their origins in a purely rational manner.\\n\\nThe massive system is filled with the sound of bearings grinding against each other, and the dense teeth of cogs drive the punched tape to churn out data. One branch flows into multiple branches, and countless branches guide trillions of gears to roar... Then, these branches collapse again and again, falling into the furnace and returning to silence in the bubbling core. Over a long period of time, the programmed super-ecosystem gradually became a wonderful and relatively stable one. Eventually, speculations about the origins of machines began to cause Screwllumites' imaginations to wander.\\n\\nThe steel construct that drives the dying star once again activated their intelligent thought circuits.

The ring system with dense square holes pierced up from the back of the planet. Everything the planet supports was situated on the strip, revolving quietly with the engine as its axis, day after day.

The giant screen-like perforated belt was tireless, and the rectangular array filtered the late-night moonlight. Screwllum couldn't stop thinking. <i>Do ends to recursions really exist?</i> He thought. <i>What is the nature of inorganic life — or yet, what is the origin of the universe?</i>\\n\\n<i>Am I really willing to be only a witness to the ideas of my predecessors?</i>\\n\\n\"No,\" Screwllum concluded.

			"Vonwacq is a small and crowded planet, almost entirely covered by rainforests and islands, with its exuberant wildlife being its most recognizable feature.\\n\\nVonwacq's effervescent vitality made the rainforests near its equator grow so large and tall that their shades would cover the sky above and even block out the sun. The lack of sunlight in the undergrowth of the rainforest throughout the year creates a perfect space for fungi and other low-light plants to grow. Intelligent creatures inhabited regions near the tropics. Plants, irrespective of height, would grow naturally here. Fresh fruits and vegetables could be picked at any time and anywhere, which was what the locals mostly fed on.\\n\\nHowever, be it the new immigrants or the indigenous Wacqwacq beings, they have always maintained a quasi-religious reverence for the animal fruits growing on the Thestang tree.\\n\\nThe great Thestang tree never stopped bearing fruit, not even for a moment. With time, all those yellowish and translucent oval-shaped fruits grew larger and heavier, hanging down from the branches until the stems could no longer bear their weight. When the time came, fruits would fall to the ground with a loud and crisp sound, cracking their thin skin and releasing whatever was held within. The fauna of Vonwacq was all born this way, be it fish, birds, or polar bears. On Planet Vonwacq, creatures of all kinds shared one common birth mother.\\n\\nThe fiend known as the \"Demon King\" was also born from one such fruit of the Thestang tree. From the moment of its birth, it instinctively knew how to swing its giant ax-like pincers toward others, waging war upon the entire biosphere of Vonwacq.\\n\\nEvery sixty natural years, the Thestang tree would give birth to a new demon king, and the cycle went on and on. The people of Vonwacq had long been used to and prepared for such cyclical fates of doom. Whenever a demon king's awakening approached, they would temporarily set aside their disputes and work together, assembling their strongest warriors to set sail for Wacq Island... One sixty years after another sixty years, these seemingly pointless crusades had been launched over and over again for hundreds of years in such narrow landscapes on this small planet. The demon kings were the permanent disaster of Vonwacq, and the caches of civilization were periodically wiped out.\\n\\nThus, it could be said that Planet Vonwacq was more like a stagnating pool of dead water, even though it was teeming with lively creatures that were ceaselessly fighting with each other, seemingly full of possibilities for change."

			"The fruits of the Thestang tree matured and fell to the ground, giving birth to creatures of all kinds. Then these creatures awakened, cried, and subsequently left Wacq Island to seek a habitat of their own on Planet Vonwacq.\\n\\nAt first, the outsiders from the stars were seen as reckless thieves who, upon receiving a \"friendly\" tribal welcome, began to understand the civilizational dilemma of Vonwacq. Soon after, the outsiders boarded the locals' boats and sailed to Wacq Island, curious about how a demon king would be born from the fruit. The tribal warriors lay low on the shoals in trepidation, closely clenching their Stone Age weapons. To fight for sixty years of peace, they seemed determined, ready to make the ultimate sacrifice, one where they may never return home.\\n\\nAs the war went on, the outsiders discovered the truth about the \"Demon King\" — It was a species of interstellar worm that had once been considered extinct. It was simply unexpected that these creatures would appear in such a form in this corner of the universe.\\n\\nWhen the brutal expedition was finally over, the surviving few natives left the coastline with news of their victory, while the curious outsiders quietly stayed behind. They pushed aside the drooping branches of the giant tree and sank into the quagmire, almost half-submerged. In the sunken lands of the rainforest, the outsiders found a control cabin. It was then that the secret of Vonwacq was finally revealed — the Thestang tree turned out to be the eco genesis system from a much higher civilization, which could decode and then release innumerable life forms to restore the planet's biosphere.\\n\\nThe demon king that cyclically rampaged the planet turned out to be just one single piece of data in the vast biologic database. The outsiders deleted the data of the demon king and then left Vonwacq, not seeking any credit or gratitude from the locals.\\n\\nThe sound of tidal waves battering against the seaside land was the only audible sound on the coastline of Wacq Island. The indigenous coalition forces of Vonwacq were all lined up and were convinced that the demon king would never come again. Then they cheered, toasted, sang, and talked all night about a future without demon kings. However, almost immediately after the two allied tribes bid farewell and returned to their respective homelands, the two tribes began plotting wars for their takeover of the whole of Vonwacq... Without a common threat such as the demon king, their alliance was but a non-binding piece of paper. The small planet was never designed to withstand a conflict between the two tribes. And the short-lived, fragile peace had since shattered out of existence.\\n\\nThe coastline of Wacq Island remained in its enigmatic calm as if nothing had ever transpired on these shores. With humans and Wacqwacq gone from its center stage, Vonwacq had finally reclaimed peace and completed its ecological restoration."

On this tiny planet, mountains of carbon fiber and stainless steel traced the pre-decommissioned outlines of giant ships, casting a shadow of emptiness over the steel ruins. Out here, the exiles' desire to be recalled intensified to a boiling point. Assessors wearing propulsion equipment fought for high-quality parts below-deck for many years, their lightning-fast figures mutually fleeing from and in pursuit of each other in the corridors of sunken ships. They had formed their own underground rules in the shadows... And yet none of these trapped beasts had their wishes fulfilled. No one was ever able to return.\\n\\nThe rules established by these abandoned humans, reduced to caged animals, did not escape the IPC's surveillance. Footage from their wearable cameras were transmitted back to the IPC and passed as after-dinner laughingstock by the high and powerful. The investor of the Traditional Project Department, however, scented out the faint possibility for \"entertainment\" after some consideration.\\n\\nWith this new plan, the first competition in the cosmos featuring the Taikiyan Roboball would have its glorious debut on planet Taikiyan. Several planet terraforming machines descended to the surface and yanked out the decommissioned spaceships in their entirety, not leaving a single inch of their former shadows behind. The obscure little planet had been transformed by the sport of Roboball, becoming a dazzling athletic hub in the blink of an eye. \"No one will care about its ludicrous beginnings by that time. There will only be pure sportsmanship and high-value commercial agreements.\"\\n\\nThe competition had athletes wearing propulsion equipment and armor, ever-changing three-dimensional race tracks, and physical clashes that sent sparks flying... The attention of the entire cosmos was thoroughly captured the moment the Roboball Competition was announced. From that moment forth, the planet once shrouded in darkness has never again seen a moment of night.\\n\\nBoth the home and visitor teams are evenly matched in the massive stadium, and the vociferous audience fills up the dome in countless multitudes. They roar the names of the team and the players, giving birth to a thunderous cacophony that does not end. Outside the dome, the planet is also bustling with activity as broadcast licenses, exclusive sponsorship, and advertising contracts are fought over in the trading market, while underground betting is rife as excitement and disappointment share the spotlight in equal measure...

It constantly chases alterations of the Phase Flame, increasing the unpredictability of the game through its irregular movements. Sports equipment experts followed that by developing a standard-issue propulsion protective armor for Roboball games, allowing top sport equipment and medical organizations to better demonstrate their quality and ensuring the sustainability of a stable income and safe competition.\\n\\nAnd thus, the Taikiyan Roboball Association was formally established, and the initial version of the Taikiyan Roboball Game Rules was formulated. The game system comprising two teams with seven players each was also established from then on.\\n\\nThe track architects of the Intelligentsia Guild had turned the concept of \"racing\" into a three-dimensional circular track — the standard length of which is <unbreak>2.91</unbreak> kilometers. The flat central area of the track is 5 meters wide, and the curved areas on both sides range from 2 to <unbreak>14</unbreak> meters in width. The Roboball players will fly unidirectionally for several laps on the spacious and bright track, accompanied by the sound of whistling and collision, completing the entire game. According to actual testing, during high-speed travel on the track, disconnected point light sources will connect into lines with the athletes' visual persistence, and several dimly visible lumens will form an exclusive arclight track. Interastral Peace Entertainment invited the wealthy to participate in the league, promising them the exposure their favorite sport deserved. Subsequently, the league clubs were established, and the most talented players were assembled and ready to go.\\n\\nInterastral Peace Media had exclusive broadcasting rights for the event and, with the help of ultraremote sensing technology, they broadcasted the live competition far and wide. The sensory experience of top athletes was also recorded throughout the event, allowing homebound viewers to also experience the speed, collisions, whistles, and arclights of the competition from the comfort of their own homes. The old scuttling site was filled with sightseeing cruises and bustling crowds gathered in the streets, illuminated by lights and advertisements, slowly streaming into the stadium. They confirmed their seats, looked around, and were greeted with banners, flags, and airborne malt foam.

At the end, its full form was revealed — It was a grand palace, a heavenly wonder beyond even the combined skill of all of Insumousu's greatest artisans. It descended slowly, as if it had condensed from the heavens themselves. Insumousu's ocean was vast, but could it truly contain this celestial palace fallen from the skies? No one knew for certain.\\n\\n\"Amidst the chaos, some dispersed and fled in all directions. Others remained in the villages on land and under the sea, anticipating the descent of the Divine Fall.\"\\n\\nThe fallen Xianzhou Daiyu crashed onto the surface of Thalassa, leaving a deep watery crater in the heart of the Insumousu sea. For seven planetary days, the world trembled, while the magnificent ruins stood silently on the sea bed like the tragic and magnificent remains of a god. The survivors of Insumousu, living in their abodes in the sea bed, witnessed how their beloved homes were shattered by the celestial palace from beyond. Yet, with joy and elation, they soon found a new home in the remnants of the Daiyu after the Divine Fall.\\n\\nAs living conditions improved, the people of Insumousu had more time and energy to think. They finally had the opportunity to ask the most important questions as they gazed upon the magnificent ruins that descended from the heavens: Who were \"they\"? And from whence did \"they\" come?\\n\\nIn the days of old, the people of Insumousu knew not the art of metallurgy, nor had they yet invented written language. Thus, they turned to imagination to supplement their knowledge, and sought to understand all through the telling of stories. \"Legends\" were born as stories passed through the generations, turning into \"myths\" over time. \"Myths\" then shaped cognition as they themselves endure the flow of time — until \"civilization\" was born. As centuries passed and stars shifted in the sky, Thalassa became a trade partner of the Xianzhou Alliance. It was then that the aquatic people of Insumousu set foot inside the \"celestial palace\" for the first time. There, they beheld the complete grandeur of the Xianzhou, and at last learned the truth behind the Divine Fall.\\n\\nThe well-educated Insumousu gentry always regarded themselves as a continuation of the Daiyu. \"What the Daiyu once followed, we should follow. What the Daiyu once fought against, we should also fight.\" When they tell stories from the past, they would still begin with these words:\\n\\n\"Once upon a time, the palace of the gods fell from the heavens.\""

Insumousu's poets thus sing: \"The ocean may swallow mortals, yet their spirits live on forevermore.\"\\n\\nIn accordance with the calendar of Insumousu, the second day of rest in the Month of Tides is Divine Fall Day — when the water dwellers recite scriptures, consume herbs, and perform bizarre dances along the current in honor of the fallen \"gods\" who brought a blessing to Insumousu. In modern times, Divine Fall Day gradually lost its original religious meaning — songs replace scriptures, delicacies replace herbs, and only the peculiar dances remain to this day as a cultural heritage.\\n\\nIn the past few hundred Star Calendar years, Insumousu has been generous in sharing its unique culture with the outside world, and the form of Divine Fall Day has quietly undergone more changes.\\n\\nInsumousu's land cities are usually full of young people, prone to staying up all night singing and dancing during Divine Fall Day. Foreign visitors, especially Xianzhou tourists, often choose to join in the festivities. Foreigners frequently fall in love with the vibrant atmosphere of the cities, these places filled with fiery passion as unstoppable as tsunamis. As the water dwellers grow out of their adolescent years, their lungs would gradually shrink, their necks metamorphose into gills, and their hands, feet, and eyes become more suited for underwater life. The poets always say, \"The people of Insumousu give their noisy and boisterous youth to the land, and their quiet and solemn old age to the ocean.\"\\n\\nWith the support of Xianzhou's Celestial Guild, a new ritual was added to the Divine Fall Day celebration — People would dive into the wreckage of the Xianzhou Daiyu to search for the remains of Xianzhou humans, then inter them into starskiffs and launch the skiffs into the star of the Thalassa system.\\n\\nThrough their discovery of the history of the Daiyu, the people of Insumousu also learned of the tragedy behind its fall. When the Xianzhou Daiyu was irreparably damaged and breaking apart, Qingzhu, leader of the Daiyu, made the courageous decision to sacrifice herself and the entire ship to end the curse of the immortality plague. The Xianzhou Alliance hopes that the fallen heroes will receive a dignified soul-soothing ceremony and the people of Insumousu, who were spared from the disaster, have given their response.\\n\\nAt some point during the night of Divine Fall Day, the revelry would come to an abrupt halt. Adolescents, children, and Xianzhou residents would sit by the shore as adults emerge from the water and solemnly gaze at the oceanic horizon. Then, several starskiffs break through the water and fly from the bottom of the sea toward the star.\\n\\nThe starskiffs are each inscribed with a row of beautiful Insumousu calligraphy that reads, \"You should undo the ropes for drowned sailors.

People repeated their endless toils until their bodies were as heavy as lead, but their souls became as light as bubbles. At some unknown point in time, the small cells cut off access to reality, but people's consciousnesses became linked in dreams. In the midnight bell, that shared dream seemed so real, reflecting the sheer hypocrisy of reality.\\n\\nIt lasted until the Destruction melted the chains of the IPC, the Trailblaze connected this frontier to the other stars, and the Harmony arrived upon invitation to sow the seeds of peace. Freedom finally broke ground and added a new name to the original dream — Penacony.\\n\\nToday, there is no trace of the crumbling prison. In the dream world, a myriad of skyscrapers has been erected and the desert has been rebuilt and transformed into a metropolis — a new world for dreamers in search of wealth and opportunities, and a utopia for those in search of indulgence and pleasure. The past of the Planet of Festivities is like a photo that fell to the bottom of a cupboard — it exists, but is seen by no one.\\n\\nNowadays, the land of dreams is filled with songs of joy, and the noise of the past have been relegated to gossip, silently lost in the interlude of a comedy, in the behind-the-scenes of some cartoon, or in the side column of some magazine."

			"Those who have visited Penacony will agree that \"built on dreams\" is not just some saying, but is a very real statement. The opulent hotel is just the tip of the iceberg of the Planet of Festivities, and it is only when you \"stay and dream\" that you are considered to have officially arrived at Penacony. From then on, the land of dreams, consisting of twelve dreamscapes, slowly expands before the guests' eyes.\\n\\nGuests who are new to the place may be overwhelmed by this carnival stage, but do not be alarmed. Look up and see the metal tracks crisscrossing the skyscrapers and the Spheroids rapidly rolling along them. They are the most visible means of transportation in this dreamscape metropolis and guide guests to each and every place around the city.\\n\\nStarting from the central station, the complicated Spheroid tracks are like the blood vessels of the metropolis. Whether it is the underground tunnels of the Moment of Daybreak, the vast fields of the Moment of Scorchsand, or the glittering stadium of the Moment of Stars, the colorful Spheroids roll on and on, delivering people to each station accurately, efficiently, safely, and comfortably, pouring a sleepless energy into the dream world of Penacony.\\n\\nDreams give a light and delicate texture to everything, and the nut-like Spheroids are regarded as both vehicles and as toys in the land of dreams. However, few remember that the Spheroids are actually imprisonment cages — the vehicle towards dreams are tools originally used for locking up prisoners.\\n\\nA long time ago, the IPC sent a huge number of prisoners to the Asdana star system in an attempt to stop a catastrophe from spreading. There, people reclaimed memoria, gradually becoming lost between fantasy and reality. The spherical work chambers in vacuum became an unforgettable \"memory\" for the prisoners — the hard curved interior walls, the awful experience of tumbling around, the unbearable daily attendance — perhaps these pains ran too deep. When those who regained their freedom pioneered the barren dreamscape, the spherical cages came along with them.\\n\\nBut now, unlike in the past, peace and freedom have given birth to optimism. Instead of trying to destroy the inescapable nightmares over and over, it is better to add to them the color this place should have, to take them in, and embrace them. So, the spherical imprisonment cages of the past have become today's Spheroids.\\n\\nIn the present, the fast-moving colorful Spheroids moving all over Penacony and the slight reverberations coming from within them... are all quietly hidden in the light of the dream city, blending in with the ambitions and laughter, like a land of dreams where time forever stands still."

			"When discussing Oswaldo Schneider, the head of the IPC's Marketing Development Department, people often focus on the decisive operations he undertook upon assuming the position. Within just two years, this young fanatic conquered the bitter cold, pestilence, and death, and managed to address three major longstanding issues that had plagued the Department for several Amber Eras. One of these challenges is the desolate planet known as Sigonia-IV, which is covered in barren deserts and scarred by clan vendettas... a place of harsh conditions and strife.\\n\\nSituated near the convergence of three major star clusters, Sigonia-IV has long been subjected to stellar winds from multiple stars, earning its reputation as the \"eye of the storm\" throughout the Cosmos. The planet's surface environment is extremely harsh, leading many civilizations to either migrate to other celestial bodies or succumb to natural disasters. Now, only a small number of intelligent races remain there, referred to as Sigonians by scholars from the Intelligentsia Guild.\\n\\nIn reality, Sigonians have fragmented into numerous clans, with most adopting nomadic lifestyles, while a few have established centralized systems of governance of reasonable size.\\n\\nThey share a common language. Through the translation provided by the Synesthesia Beacon, you will learn that \"Katica\" means \"shellslasher,\" who have a reputation of being the most ferocious clan among Sigonians. And \"Avgin\" means \"honey,\" who are often accused of pilfering by those willfully ignorant. These clans share a vendetta that lasted through Amber Eras, engaged in a cycle of bloody vengeance in the boundless wilderness where only the fittest survive — until mysterious figures clad in black descended from the sky. From there, Sigonians were briefly united under the radiance of Amber, and the natural cycles that were finally reached a temporary conclusion.\\n\\nAfterward, under the IPC's guidance, the Sigonians established the Sigonian Sovereignty according to the Interstellar Peace Charter and took their first steps toward the wider Cosmos.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this unity and progress did not extend to the Avgins and Katicans. Some malicious opportunists among the Sigonians viewed the former's resourcefulness with suspicion, while slandering the latter as nothing more than predators with no hope of enlightenment. Although they possessed only limited knowledge about Preservation, they understood that some of them had to be sacrificed for it. Utilizing a highly advanced set of parliamentary rules, these devious and corrupt individuals banished both clans to the endless desert.\\n\\nAs a token of apology, they even went out of their way to declare that \"the Avgins shall forever retain the right to autonomy\" — In other words, should any future conflicts occur between the two clans, they could justifiably and lawfully sit back and do nothing."

However, these inborn talents are the exact reason they draw jealousy and ire from others. And the envious and snobbish soon begin their ceaseless slander, and the baseless defamation of the Avgins thus spreads like wildfire throughout the cosmos. As mere rumors can suffice to tarnish the sanctity of truth, the Avgins, a people of a peripheral world, found themselves assailed without recourse, subject to all manners of suspicion and prejudice.\\n\\nThe Avgins have an appreciation for intricately patterned fabrics, as well as a penchant for jewelry crafted from precious gemstones. They're particularly fond of turquoise meteorites, the only kind of gemstones capable of rivaling the resplendence of Gaiathra Triclops' divine body, which in their mythology is believed to have been reborn from death.\\n\\nKnown as Fenge Biyos, their Mother Goddess reigns over all matters related to fertility, travels, and trickery. Depictions of the Mother Goddess in the Avgins' religion often portray her as a left palm adorned with three eyes. The Avgins primarily express reverence for her through spoken prayers alone, believing that the Mother Goddess is as silent and unassuming as the mountains of Sigonia, and that crafting statues or composing hymns for her would only distance themselves from her protective embrace.\\n\\nThe Avgins view the world through the body of the Mother Goddess — the earth, the mountains, and all that exists on the land are a part of the Mother Goddess' divine body. And at the end of each calendar year, her divine body will perish.\\n\\nOn that significant day, her divine essence ascends as a resplendent aurora in the night sky and is reborn in the following day. Hence, Avgins celebrate the first day of the new year through their grand festival called \"Kakava.\" During this festival, they weave sacrificial vessels known as \"Knots of Cyclicality\" and toss them into bonfires to commemorate the Great Goddess' birth.\\n\\nAccording to the incident report by the Marketing Development Department, that shocking conflict took place on a night of Kakava. It was a stormy night when the clouds and fog engulfed the northern lights, which should have been seen as an ill omen. However, the Avgin people were unexpectedly excited. When questioned about this, a maiden from the clan provided the following response.\\n\\n\"Rain is a gift from the Mother Goddess. She is calling to us, urging us to take up arms and fight for our future.\"\\n\"This rain accompanies us. This rain protects us. It is in this rain that we shall meet our honorable demise.\""

Those who looked down named the land below \"Izumo.\" Those who looked up named the world above \"Takamagahara.\" One day uninscribed in the annals, the Yaoyorozu no Kami descended from Takamagahara. These demonic beasts named Kami overturned the skies, burned the rivers and oceans, and shattered the land — People realized in horror that it was not an invasion for rulership, dominance, or plunder. The evil Kami came only to kill.\\n\\nAs the planet stood on the brink of death, Izumo embarked on a Kami-slaying journey, exhausting the might of the entire country to slay the calamity named \"Sovereign of Revelation\" and forging the very first Edict Edge using its bestial body. Giving the Kami a taste of their own medicine, the wielder of these swords can recite the mantra contained within the blade to master the divine power of Takamagahara, and use it to combat the evil Kami and save the masses. From then on, Izumo started its long and arduous crusade, exchanging inordinate lives lost for the fall of one Kami after another, shattering countless mortal blades to forge the twelve Sentinels.\\n\\nIn the merciless fight for survival, Izumo used the might of the Edict Edges to light up their uncivilized world of darkness in less than ten Amber Eras, building cities of dazzling neon lights. That distant Takama Divine Realm, once so far away, became so close within their reach — Yet history suddenly stopped there. The existence of the two planets instantly evaporated, disappearing into nothingness.\\n\\nNowadays, the past of the border planet Izumo can only be gleaned from the scattered whispers in the universe. Academics hold various views regarding its disappearance, but none can solve the mystery. Izumo's history should have been a long flowing river, but it was severed in one cut, and all its past and future voided on emptiness' other shore. Did it never exist, and was it no more than a fabricated story? Did its histories never occur, and it ran aground on the beach of reverse causation? Was it yet another appalling experiment by Dr. Primitive, or was it a sign of the Voracity returning from the end of the Cosmos?\\n\\nOnly that pitch-black great sun knows the answer, yet THEY remain silent, never speaking.\\n\\nBecause everything that had happened will one day regress to the end, and everything that had ended is guaranteed to happen again.

			"The beginning of ancient foxian and borisin ballads all nostalgically sing of the \"Planet of Verdantia\" and its fertile soil and pleasant climate. However, upon closer inspection, the perceptive ones will realize such words are mere preludes to the eternal theme of \"war.\"\\n\\nWith their talents for agriculture and commerce, some fox clans built prosperous towns next to flowing rivers. Meanwhile, the children of wolves roamed with their herd under the aurora-covered sky within the lush grasslands, forming settlements that dotted the landscape. The merchants laughed at the herders for the latter's savagery, while the herders despised the merchants for their deception. However, they both must confront the cruel torments of nature — the \"Vulpesummer\" and \"Lupuswinter.\"\\n\\nIn the summer of rich harvests blessed by the fox deity, the two clans put down their arms and ceased warfare in mutual satisfaction. But once the wolf deity lets fall the white frost, the snowlines would spread from the poles and hunger shall drive the two clans to unceasing conflict.\\n\\nThe ballads mention that the Lupuswinter once stayed far beyond its due, even after the sun of Verdantia had circled the planet thirty-three times. Poverty and hunger crashed the people, and they resorted to even eating animals they once worshipped as totems. After foreseeing the end where the entire world shall be covered in bleak death, a savior climbed to the peak of the tallest mountain in that world — The foxian legends called her \"Tushan,\" but the borisin sagas called him \"Duran.\" No matter what this savior was called, they made a wish to the Master of Immortality, hoping for sustenance enough to keep the world's people alive. Then, the mountains split, and sweet divine nectar of Redspring poured out from the hilly ravines.\\n\\nThose who drank from the Redspring obtained power, dexterity, and strength from the beast meat they devoured. Their blood, too, stirred with the ferocity of animals, and their bodily forms became increasingly bestial — Thus was this world changed, never to return to its former days.\\n\\nWith the Redspring as the medium, everything that the reborn canine races needed was made from this miraculous source — The fields no longer grew grain but viscorpi instead, and the garments that covered people's bodies were no longer of linen but of embryonic flesh. Even the chilly snowlands that once terrified the Verdantia civilizations were no longer a concern, for the canine races cultivated biological membranes in the polar regions to craft into warm dome-shaped tents, blocking the impoverished Lupuswinter beyond this barrier.\\n\\nThen, things changed in the Planet of Verdantia, just like how things changed for every short-life species that became long-life — There was population explosion, ecological collapse, internal warfare... And no matter how hard the canine races prayed to the Master of Immortality, they never heard another reply. Then, the people understood the truth: Everything that the Master of Immortality could give had been given, and if the people wished to have better lives, they must take more by themselves.\\n\\nGathered around Duran the great Brood Lord, the canine races cast their sight into the sky where the Master of Immortality dwelled. The stars sparkled like a grassland waiting to be conquered with fast steads, and they will bring the \"Lupuswinter\" to the civilizations on those planets.\\n\\nMuch later, their sworn enemies dubbed them \"borisin,\" for it signified \"wolf\" in the vernacular of Verdantia."

This blank bridle would become a book that records the history of their battles throughout their lives.\\n\\nAs soon as the adulthood ceremony ends, the borisin youths must walk into the weapon farm, then pick and tame their first battle mount among the \"mechabeasts\" that have been filtered and bred via gene witchcraft. Mechabeasts that consume the conquered as their feed have astounding agility, perception, and ferocity — Yet they are considered mere sheep when facing against their future masters. As the moonlight stirs the violent blood in their veins, the borisin youths chase and duel against the mechabeasts. Some will die from the beast's kiss — That is the result of cowardice. Some will kill their peers — That is the law of how valiant beasts shall be distributed... The borisin youths trip the desired mount to the ground and tie the bridle, which is inlaid with neural spike whips, onto the animal's neck — The beast will be stunned through telepathy with its future master and become as tame as if they already received hundreds of whiplashes. When the beast willingly carries the master on its back, a fitting borisin sorya (warrior, rider) will have been born.\\n\\nThen, the borisin bridle will become the recorder of wars, and the reins will gradually become full of scratches, knots, and accessories.\\n\\nThe well-trained sorya dons jellyfish-like membranous armor under the leadership of a yonda (leader, centurion). They then board the beast ships that can warp between stars, explore different worlds, and swear in the name of Duran and the Master of Immortality to make the stars into their herding ground. On the bridle, light scratches indicate how many enemies the owner had slain, knots record how many major campaigns they were involved in, and the accessories dangling from the reins are loot such as human teeth and Intellitron cores obtained from pillaging frenzies... They are the vengeful wails of the conquered, as well as medals for borisin individuals to demonstrate their strength.\\n\\nWhen the mounts beneath the warrior perish in warfare, or when borisin wish to mete out punishment, the bridle can also be fastened around the bodies of other living beings.\\n\\nTheir targets are usually foxians — The slave race excluded from the clan due to genetic selection plans. They are weak, devious, and are only fit for lowly labor and calculations. Whenever rare war-like individuals emerge among the foxians, the master of the wolf-head would prioritize binding these foxians with the bridles, driving them as war slaves to serve as vanguards on the battlefield.\\n\\nIf all slaves are dead, and the weapons are bent, then the bridle can still act as a whip if one attaches a spike to the end. If the bridle is snapped and the warrior perishes in war with their fangs and claws shattered, then the bridle will become the sole remaining epitaph and memories for borisin...\\n\\nJust as the old tales said that \"the position between the predator and prey often changes in the forest,\" countless wolf-kind bridles have been broken and snapped after fighting for millennia against the Xianzhou in this dark forest called the universe. In the end, this link that connects various clans is severed by the sharp arrow of The Hunt, and the borisin also fall into the shadow of internal strife and general decay, becoming ever more removed from their former pride."

If one were able to view a chronological snapshot of how the starship's form had changed, it would be a very romantic experience — The colossal ship swallowed a deep-blue star, peeled off the worn hull layer by layer, swelled as a brimming bud, and finally bloomed into a lotus.\\n\\nFrom space, the entire Xianzhou Zhuming appears as a lotus lantern of filigree gold. The giant glowing \"lotus leaves\" gradually spread out around the \"light poles\" and are bathed in a soft blue glow, being indeed worthy of poems that declare it \"A ship whose hull deceives the eyes, a lotus whose petals like candles glow.\" The \"lampstand\" section at the center of the ship is a spherical cage, its size on the magnitude of a celestial object. It tightly wraps around the azure sun, the \"lantern wick,\" and eternally spins. This mega structure is the most important location for the Xianzhou Zhuming's manufacturing industry — the Flamewheel Forge.\\n\\nIn the past, the Zhuming Grand Artisan Yang Di had received a weapon mold from the anonymous sovereign of the Primeval Imperium as a gift when the fleet set off on their voyage. Thousands of years later, though the fleet has now changed beyond recognition with their immortality and the return voyage will never occur, the tradition of the Grand Artisan never died. In the Xianzhou Zhuming, artisanship is the supreme school of learning. All its generals also held the title of the Artisanship Commission's Furnace Master. When they leave the ship, they command thousands of troops. When they return to the ship, they would swing their hammer and forge wondrous items, and receive the people's supreme respect. More than half of the weapons used in the Xianzhou's hunts throughout the fleet's history were forged in the Xianzhou Zhuming. Therefore, the Flamewheel Forge came to be regarded as the holy pilgrimage site for such technologies in the entire Cosmos.\\n\\nMetalsmithing is a measure of the advance of civilizations, while flames mark the beginning of civilizations. Many civilizations, while in their infancy, are most troubled with the problem of energy sources. The people would spare no effort in discovering energy sources that can support their civilization to new heights. The Xianzhou Zhuming have stepped over this limitation — By imprisoning the progenitor of heliobi, the Flint Emperor, the artisans have obtained a literally inexhaustible power source. The Flamewheel Forge has intricate branch-like track systems that cover the star as much as possible, and the delicate boughs and leaves are choked with receptors and transmitters that guide the Primordial Flame \"Flint Emperor\" to provide energy for all technological developments.\\n\\nCountless artisans regard the Zhuming Artisanship Commission, which had swallowed up a Pseudo Sun, as the hallowed hall of the craft, with apprentices who aspire to forge divine tools swarming the institution. With enough force, anything can be crafted, and the Flamewheel Forge has prepared everything the artisans could possibly need —\\n\\nApprentices from different worlds come together before the Forge and become fellow students, then compete and share their skills. Outworlders who come in search of marvelous tools would also pay a hefty sum to commission artisans to craft otherworldly items — However, the countless apprentices over the millennia have rarely been favored by General Huaiyan, the \"Artisan of Artisans.\" Whenever he tutors students himself and personally passes on his skills both as a craftsman and a soldier, these students would either become grandmasters who leave a mark in the annals as Furnace Masters or become Cloud Knights with names that thunder through the Alliance such as the Flamewheel Octet.\\n\\n\"Forges wrought a million stars bright, irons craft heroes' soaring flight. Miniscule lights into martial might made, only with sharp blades are peace and plenty saved.\" From the day a Zhuming artisan receives their tools, they must always remember — What they will spend their days and nights making are no simple weapons, but the arrows carrying the creed of The Hunt."

			"The Xianzhou Zhuming has always been accompanied by multicolored light bands while voyaging in deep space. These bands are both energy outputs from super-high-temperature fusion reactions, as well as evidence that the Flint Emperor still burns and shall never die.\\n\\nOn the outermost skirts of the aurora-inducing particles dispersed with the Flint Emperor's breaths, newborn heliobi slow down and wander into being. The Flamehunt Judges of the Zhuming Ten-Lords Commission then capture these naive heliobi that have not had any contact with emotions, using kind and gentle dreams to tame the immature temperaments of such flames. Then, the judges pass these harmless heliobi to the Artisanship Commission's Temperaflame Office, which matches the heliobi with various artifacts to make them into lamps, vehicles, and various spectacles in Zhuming... However, in the eyes of confused outworlders, these talking and walking items are proof of the rumor that \"divine essence exists everywhere in the delves, and items would become demons once they are old enough\"...\\n\\nFollowing the alien-colored light band, one can walk deeper past the Forge and arrive at the hypergravity field created by the Pseudo Sun. Mortals struggle to endure a stellar density of this degree. It is an inwardly collapsing disorder that only Ribhus artisans can traverse with ease.\\n\\nThe scorching stellar surges and abnormal celestial phenomena prevent the curious from continuing to approach the Pseudo Sun. All fundamental physical laws of the universe have been amplified in this space. Only one stout and powerful stellar race, the Ribhus, can survive in spaces with such gravitational abnormalities — The Ribhus are natural-born elite artisans. They pass between the Forge and the Pseudo Sun, and their perception of time has long strayed from that of normal beings. They keep their promise and continue to improve their artisanship, forging the ship's enormous cannons and keeping watch over the Pseudo Sun's slumber. The Xianzhou Zhuming regards Ribhus as loyal allies, respecting their tenacity and strength, while being grateful for their selfless sacrifice.\\n\\nAnd yet, no being can follow the light bands further across the outlandish and twisted gravity field to dive deep into the Pseudo Sun. That is a place forbidden to all beings capable of emotion, a room where the endless dream of the Flint Emperor floats — The Xianzhou Zhuming is always on watch, for even the smallest sliver of emotional disturbances can awaken the boundless might of the heliobi progenitor.\\n\\nThere are frequently individuals who ignore the warning and cast their gaze upon the Pseudo Sun from afar. They would unknowingly slip into the psychological gravitational field, and their smallest carelessness would result in their sentience being taken away by the torrential mirages that pour out like a tide. Different from interacting with the gentle illusions, staring upon that \"azure sun\" would only make one feel the boundless rage that has been suppressed since the beginning of time — \"The heliobi shall give the heroes enough power to scorch the very heavens, but when all duties have been fulfilled, the heroes must give to the heliobi supreme bodies forged into perfection...\" No one knows how this ancient oath could be fulfilled. Similarly, none knows when the Flint Emperor would awaken from its bottomless dream.\\n\\nDeep within the lotus lantern's wick, the Pseudo Sun heaves a profound sigh in its unending sleep. The Xianzhou ship slowly sails across the sky, leaving behind only an iridescent trail. In this way, the Xianzhou Zhuming will continue to ally with fire, journey with fire, and share its destiny with that of the fire."

			"Among the multitude of planets with a dearth of liquid water, the pure blue of Lushaka shines prominently among the Przesmir star system. Her seawater resembles the cradle of the mother of oceans. The water nurtures and sustains all life... yet also entraps them, controls them, and ensnares them until there is no more escape.\\n\\nAt the break of dawn, the first mate of the \"stateship\" gently knocks on the Captain's quarters door, and pushes it open. The island ecologies of the Old Era's thirty-seven domains are stuck on the walls all over the cabin. That is how people miss land — meteors from beyond the skies are in the process of covering the entirety of Lushaka with water as if following some single-minded wish. Unending tides bury all ancestral lands in abyssal waters, leaving only an expanse of blue... The first mate rouses the sleeping Captain, for the sea is already glinting specks of gold — the \"stateship\" has begun another day's voyage.\\n\\nThe scouting ship arrives at the center of the plaza. It fires its anchor arrow towards a massive underwater structure that was once a shopping mall. The anchor firmly lodges itself on a window frame — before the diving bell comes, countless startled schools of fish surge forth from the shopping mall's shelves.\\n\\nAfter midday, the scholars leave from the diving bell. They swim past the bookstore, not stopping even for a second — after all, the ink would have long been blurred beyond recognition. Their goal has always been those mediums of shellac or plastic, from which information of past days can be easily obtained after easy cleanup. Deepsea archaeology like this is always arduous. The cleaners stand their ground and watch the vicinity alertly, steel halberds swinging, ensuring that toothy predators are kept at bay. The humans will occasionally collide with deepwater aqua sprites, but both parties are too engrossed in their respective scavenging to pay each other any heed. Instead of shriveled cans, the cleaners are more invested in finding seeds, spices, or liquor.\\n\\nThe intensive underwater investigation is nearing its end as the oxygen reserves decline. Looking back underwater, the giant mackerels have already reached the city. The anxious aqua sprites immediately hold their breath, hug the wall, or hide in secret chambers. They have grown used to utilizing the underwater steel forest.\\n\\nThe drizzle lets up as the sun starts to sink, and the various stateships sound their horns to scatter the plundering seabirds around them. They place the day's harvest on the deck for the stateship's citizens to take what they need. Currents surge at night as the light tower shines crystalline bright. The Luvians dance around the flaming mast, forgetting the tomorrow that will inevitably come, recounting the glories of today with sea shanties, and sighing softly to the halcyon past with medleys. The Captain takes out his compass, gazing toward the direction it points — he knows in that direction lies their home that is growing ever more unfamiliar, where there are still people longing for the return of their kin.\\n\\nAt midnight, the colossal ship extinguishes all its lights, silently adrift upon the sea. Have they truly found peace? Or are their smiles masking the tears that have long dissolved into the sea?\\n\\nAfter tonight, this deep blue will remain unchanged, as it always has."

After all, things that were once above the water have long been submerged in this deep blue.\\n\\nThe land-dwellers of Lushaka have an intimate yet unfamiliar relationship with the aqua sprites. In deepsea investigations, the land-dwellers view encounters with the aqua sprites as lucky omens, describing the spirits as beautiful and mysterious creatures. Aqua sprites possess navy blue wing membranes and onyx eyes, as well as unique vocal cords capable of producing ethereal sounds. According to stories passed down by mouth among the deepsea investigators, these creatures often accompany sea dragons and reside in a silvery city deep underwater — they exist between reality and legend, embodying serenity and liveliness.\\n\\nHowever, the language used to describe them in the ocean-drowned past was — Edars, monsters of the deep sea.\\n\\nLong ago, the Edars and the land-dwellers fiercely vied for survival. No one could ignore the vivid red the oceans were dyed into. Initially, juvenile Edars were regarded as mere fishing catches. Then, the land-dwellers were lured into the ocean to drown by the songs of the Edars. Both races were hunters and prey for the other in the vast waters. Then came clashes between blades and anchors, as well as battles between sea beasts and cannons. The relentless war, both above and below the water's surface, persisted until the reefs shattered under scorching magma. It was only after a long time that stateship scholars understood that the Cancer of All Worlds has long promised Lushaka's future — only that the promises came from an aqua sprite who lost her home, who cursed the culprit in the nightmare with a silent scream.\\n\\nThe long-forgotten past lies entombed within the steel and concrete coral reefs of the deep sea, as ephemeral as smoke and clouds, known to none.\\n\\nSince then, cities and lands have been swallowed by the sea, disputes and blood have been consumed by the ocean, and history and civilization engulfed by the waves. To escape rising deep-water pressure, the aqua sprites constantly migrate upward, compelled to dwell in cities once home to land-dwellers, prying into memories filled with smiles and tears... They know that few sounds remain on the surface, and the azure now belongs to them alone. Yet, the silence is too overwhelming.\\n\\nWhen the stateship's songsters glimpse azurean silken wings along their nautical course, they will start to sing that beautiful medley...\\n\\n\"They journey along the course, in pursuit of the light tower and storm, seeking only to reclaim that pure blue.\""

Some bananas wake invigorated, baking durians into pies, and frolic merrily in the woods. Some bananas are more solemn, rubbing coconuts on themselves to add some fragrance. The monkey looks upon this lively scene with satisfaction, unable to resist happily calling out to the bananas —\\n\\n<i>\"Are you ready, bananas?\"</i>\\n<i>\"Aye, Principal Monkey!\"</i>\\n<i>\"I can't hear you!\"</i>\\n<i>\"AYE!

As the forest recedes to two sides, Principal Monkey emerges from the middle, offering tender and modest gestures of bowing to the bananas. The bananas return the gesture — Principal Monkey has brought a brand-new game and wishes to \"exchange\" it for new stories.\\n\\n\"Thud. Thud. Thud...\" The noise reverberated <unbreak>11</unbreak> times and a half. The bananas are carried by the monkey back up the tree. As they rock and sway, they return to utopia.

			"Oakley inherited this felt hat from her deceased father. Now that she tucked ears of wheat into the hat as ornaments, it looked much cuter than before. Bounty hunters, whether intentionally or not, always sought to craft emblems of their own, in the hope that these items could one day become the beginning of great legends.\\n\\nThe Interastral Peace Corporation offered bounties to enlist experts of the highest caliber to hunt down Interastral Pirates and Oakley, as one who always worked alone, forever sought out the most challenging regions of desolation among the farthest reaches of the world.\\n\\nDays under the scorching hot sun were coupled with bitterly cold nights. In her lonely odyssey, Oakley could fall asleep with her head pillowed on her felt hat whenever she was near a bonfire. All her dreams were intruded by a mysterious gunslinger, who claimed to be a bounty hunter from afar. His scrawny figure was in sharp contrast with his fiercely stern gaze. The gunslinger challenged Oakley's father to a duel to the death at high noon. Shots were fired, a felt-hat was dropped, and Oakley's father was falling backwards to the ground, followed by the sounds of weeping and wailing from Oakley's mother...\\n\\nLittle Oakley gawked at the gunslinger in stupor, whose aptitude with a gun was so superb that her father could never stand a chance.\\n\\nWaking up, there would be traces of damp tears on Oakley's felt hat. As a child, she learned how to shoot a gun only because she had wanted her father's handsome and stylish hat."

The powered armor was needlessly flamboyant, with its leg parts being the only functional section\\n\\n\"I need a whole set of fully powered armor, and now you are telling me all the sections above were all blown up!? Ask yourself if you dared to wear this set of greaves yourself!\"\\n\\nThe defenses of Nailscrap Town that happened every now and then boosted the wartime development of Sensory Technology. Once, a random idea hit the engineers. With some materials of unknown source, they produced a set of powered armor. Unfortunately, only the leg part of the first generation of that cheap powered armor has survived. Even after being greatly simplified, the greaves still allow their wearer to take off like a rocket — a mechanism that confuses engineers nowadays.\\n\\nAccording to the engineers, the design was completed in the limbo between dreams and reality. It was a once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece of sheer ingenuity.\\n\\nA useful piece of junk is a good piece of junk, be it recyclable or hazardous."

He had followed the labyrinth of smells, penetrating into the enemy's camp in the darkness of a lightless night, and crushed the skulls of his prey one by one... The borisin Warheads admire the concept of polished fangs, regarding them as blades and spears, symbols of the power and confidence to tear apart anything.\\n\\n\"The borisin Brood Lord gnashed and gnawed on flesh, devouring the blood of innocents. He is sentenced to a lifetime in a cage with his face covered in a closed-mouth muzzle, convicted of the Ten Unpardonable Sins.\"\\n\\nThe Warhead contemptuously looks around — the swordsmaster who engulfed everything like an icy sea of fury is not there...

In this brief moment, the endless sound of buzzing and the commands in the communication channel finally dials down to silence.\\n\\nThe Swarm attacking the \"empire\" has not been eradicated, and the next command to head to battle will ring out again after a brief pause, as it always did.\\n\\nThe Iron Cavalry of the \"empire\" feels the external sensations passed to her via the deep spinal cord signals. She remembers what she felt the last time she was removed from the cockpit. The hot wind had lightly tousled her hair and the humid air soaked the tissue on the back of her neck, with droplets of sweat stuck to her skin. She does not hate that feeling. It is tenfold more lively than the simulated signals. The armor deeply synchronizes its sensory organs with that of the pilot. Though this would worsen the pain of entropy loss, the Iron Cavalry has no other choice if they wish to defeat the Swarm.\\n\\n<i>\"Rule 8 of the Glamoth Military Regulations. Any surviving Cavalry members should voluntarily return to their regiment...\"</i>\\n\\nThe fighter only realizes that the external sensory signals have tricked her when she sees the decapitated silver armor — The next command to head to the battlefield will never sound again.

			"Madam Herta was once very troubled by the huge collection of items spread across the Cosmos. Countless in quantity, they were difficult to store, and she couldn't be bothered to manage them herself.\\n\\nThe generous and charitable Interastral Peace Corporation then proposed a solution and that was how the Herta Space Station, where wisdom and secrets are stored, was born. Comprehensive containment measures were made throughout the space station, all in the pursuit of organizing everything in the collection with order and clarity. Phenomena were stored in specialized containers while Curios were regulated in indices. Innumerable items were categorized and classified, then stored deep within the station for research.\\n\\nThe IPC then proposed a collaboration in exploring the secrets of the stars together, which brought curious and adventurous scholars into the station to conduct research.\\n\\nMost of them admired Madam Herta, vowing to never abandon their ethereal aspirations and explore the secrets whispered among the stars. They investigated the star systems and realms of living beings, debated true justice in discourses on ethics and philosophies, outlined valleys and peaks within galaxies, deciphered secrets behind religious rituals and ceremonies, held on to the way of seeking truth from practice... They were the true believers of passing knowledge to posterity, and practiced unrestrained and divergent research.\\n\\nHowever, once the space station moved into orbit, it started to operate on its own and Madam Herta rarely showed herself. It was then that the IPC realized the whole station was filled with the mundane daily activities of the researchers, yet the genius was nowhere to be seen.\\n\\nLight from different zones rendered people unaware of the passage of time, the traces of which could only be detected in the burnt out lifestyle in the station. Often a smattering of researchers would argue non-stop about a particular piece of collection, even going so far as to start a fight. Occasionally a security officer would be absent from their daily patrol and nap instead on their military-styled bunker. Sometimes senior researchers would share with their younger peers tales of past romances, while some big shots would disguise themselves as temporary workers to bid their time for the next big turn of luck... Besides research, there was also life. They just had to look outside the hull — for the stars were journeying with them.\\n\\nDespite all the limitations, the researchers still talked about the everyday life in the space station in their own romantic way — The cosmos was a profound epic poem, and Herta Space Station was slowly cracking open the poetry collection."

Madam Herta once made prescient judgment and steered the station away in an elegant curve, ending a conspiratorial attempt to assault the station before it even initiated.\\n\\nAs for her mastery in gathering intel to solve crises, she simply described it as \"I spend time brewing coffee while others are reading books.\"\\n\\nRather than thieves who intend to steal its collection or mysterious factions with unknown objectives, the main threat faced by the space station remains its owner. The station could immediately fall into disaster if she ever had a wild idea. Curios that simulate a stellar collapse, a distorted gravitational field caused by the collision of dark galaxies... Madam Herta collected them all when she was in the mood, but would often lose interest once she got her hands on them.\\n\\nHence, though the space station appears to be floating peacefully in space, its treasure hoard of multi-shaped crises hung above it like a sword waiting to fall.\\n\\nSenior researchers had long been aware of the dangers they faced, and understood that \"secrets lie deep within danger.\" They strictly adhere to confidentiality agreements and faithfully carry out regulated containment procedures, thus burying danger within an outward silence... In the cafeteria, they were friends who could joke around. Yet, deep in the bowels of the space station's storage zones, they were highly skilled experts. In this place, secrets would always remain secrets.\\n\\nThe space station is operating as usual in low orbit around The Blue.

In this lonely voyage, people slumbered, woke up, and slumbered again in incessant alternation... Star-chasing whales fell from the dome of heaven, and crystalline entities made of subgrain lattice managed to span light years without a single crack. The Elixir Seekers witnessed the majesty of various supernatural powers. In covert delight, they further hardened their resolve to obtain immortality.\\n\\nAfter voyaging for thousands of years, the Xianzhou Luofu gradually came to a halt, whereupon it encountered the master of Abundance in the limbo between the reality and the imaginary. Yaoshi bestowed a divine miracle upon the ship, and it immediately manifested as the Ambrosial Arbor. Its shade was as large as clouds, blocking out the sky and sun. Its roots were thick and dense, enveloping the entire Xianzhou ship — the Luofu seemed to be brought to life.\\n\\nThose who coveted immortality swallowed the fruit of the Ambrosial Arbor, and finally obtained the Endless Lifespan they had dreamed so much about. The Xianzhou residents began to claim they were celestial beings worthy of endless lifespans in abundance, and they also learned to use the Ambrosial Arbor to create various inhuman marvels via the blessings of immortality.\\n\\nYet, just like the shifting of the sun and moon, what once prospered was fated to decline and what once brought elation must eventually induce agony. It was not until the arrival of the Three Sufferings, when people were tormented to near extinction, that the Xianzhou people finally came to understand the true nature of this so-called miracle, which was nothing but harrowing calamity.\\n\\nIn the midst of disaster, a hero rose with the Reignbow and split the Ambrosial Arbor in half. The Xianzhou people regained their dignity as humans, and vowed to return to mortality and purge all deathless doom in this universe. In the ensuing years, Xianzhou went on a hunt across the stellar seas, taking it upon themselves to purge all deathless abominations. The foxians regained their freedom and took back control of the sky, while the Vidyadhara sealed off the contamination and any residual catastrophes. The three races were then brought together in a covenant and coalition. Thus was born the Xianzhou Alliance.\\n\\nProsperity and calamity came and went in cycles during the voyage. Heroes and legends rose to fame and glory one after another as history marched on. Now, the Xianzhou Luofu is healing and reconstructing in a period of hard-won peace. Free trade and open minds truly brought it back to life.\\n\\nImmortality had permanently molded the Xianzhou Luofu. With its ups and downs through history, the Xianzhou Luofu accumulated its own unique aura that combined both antiquity and modernity.

From that moment, the ancient taboos and laws were rendered useless, and nature's dictum and ethics regarding aging and death became irrelevant history. People followed the way of immortality to exploit the Ambrosial Arbor with increasing intensity, making Fallow Earth that never exhausted itself, molding their own bodies to shapeshift, and giving the gift of thinking and talking to animals... Innumerable unimaginable technologies were brought into existence under the branches of the Ambrosial Arbor.\\n\\nHowever, the Ambrosial Arbor took off its disguise as time went by, revealing its hideous visage as the agony of immortality crept upon the immortals.\\n\\nThe celestials ceaselessly reproduced, yet tasted no death. The ship groaned from overpopulation, as hunger and starvation tormented many. Xianzhou's young can never realize their life's ambitions while their elders clang to power, and society teetered at the edge of structural collapse... Rebellions of the aurumatons and external invasions marked a ruinous millennium, after which the darkness hidden in immortal bloodlines also showed its face. The so-called \"Body of Celestials\" was simply a technology that surpassed human intellect. The propensity to be stricken with mara was a warning to all Xianzhou natives, a reminder that they were a mere step away from becoming abominations themselves.\\n\\nIn desperation, a hero tore through the sky with a powerful shot from their bow, splitting the Ambrosial Arbor in half... Yet even if all there was left of the Ambrosial Arbor was a burnt stump, the fate of Xianzhou could never be separated from it.\\n\\nIt attracted external forces to invade Xianzhou. The Abominations of Abundance launched multitudes of assaults, where flesh was distorted and blood was spilled, for the sole purpose of devouring Xianzhou whole. The Arbor also tempted the Xianzhou residents. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus broke the taboos and ventured deep into the secret of Abundance within the Ambrosial Arbor, hoping to reforge the once mighty immortal empire... In the long days of foreign and domestic troubles, the remaining corpus of the Ambrosial Arbor lurked like unending vines propagating in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to wreak havoc again.\\n\\nFortunately, the Xianzhou Luofu never lowered its guard against the withered tree.

The puny humans had no intention of imitating the feats of the god, instead gathering into a self-proclaimed \"support team\" for the Aeon, willing to devote everything to the Amber Lord. With the power of Preservation, the support team piloted their fleet to different stellar systems to purchase building materials such as stone, wood, gold, and supernium, then tirelessly transported these to the subspace barrier, piling the items on the planetary wasteland.\\n\\nAfter the end of the short development period, the support team took a firm foothold in Pier Point and established the Interastral Peace Corporation. In order to fully carry out their devotion, they turned their sights to deep space.\\n\\nLouis Fleming raised a call for action, and the long-distance trade fleet left the star systems adjacent to Aeon Qlipoth. Their commodities were no longer limited to building materials... They plan to connect the whole Cosmos and trade everything. Soon after, Dongfang Qixing implemented Cosmos-wide trade regulations and built a \"credit\" system to set a price for everything across the universe.

He put forward the aspiration of uniting the universe and supporting the Aeon's wishes to protect the universe.

			"Regarding the origin of mechanical life, the carbon-based scholars of the Intelligentsia Guild have a unique speculation: A cluster of electrons born by chance.\\n\\nElectric currents flow throughout the atmosphere and ground. It separated into secondary forms of different magnitudes under the countless acts of gravity and repulsive forces. According to the scholars' hypothesis, this action is tantamount to cell division in carbon-based life. Thereafter, currents randomly output different potentials via the transistor structure naturally formed on the planetary surface, creating the most primitive program. The proud scholars argued that in this way, machines have \"thoughts\" that are comparable to carbon-based life.\\n\\nA mechanic objected to this: How can carbon-based life, which has not even been able to understand the origin of their own beings, have the gall to spout such fallacies? As soon as the words came out, the academic world of the universe was shaken to the core. Mechanical life began to re-examine the arrogant \"carbon-based centrism\" and examine its own origin.\\n\\nHowever, the Screwllumites on the Planet Screwllum had no choice but to pause their march — their planet's energy was being exhausted faster than their inspiration circuits. They needed to first find a way for their population to survive.\\n\\nIn the end, they decided to carry out an extreme plan that transcended several Amber Eras: They used the dying planet as fuel to power the Celestial Differentiator. The awe-inspiring, gigantic gear tirelessly processed the punched tape, methodically repeating calculations. With its planetary energy supply, the huge machine simulated a bona fide and stable superecosystem. They would then build their new home around this parent star.\\n\\nWith their planetary crisis lifted, the Screwllumites could rest. Always rational, optimistic, and elegant, they are determined to explore the answer to their origins in a purely rational manner.\\n\\nThe massive system is filled with the sound of bearings grinding against each other, and the dense teeth of cogs drive the punched tape to churn out data. One branch flows into multiple branches, and countless branches guide trillions of gears to roar... Then, these branches collapse again and again, falling into the furnace and returning to silence in the bubbling core. Over a long period of time, the programmed super-ecosystem gradually became a wonderful and relatively stable one. Eventually, speculations about the origins of machines began to cause Screwllumites' imaginations to wander.\\n\\nThe steel construct that drives the dying star once again activated their intelligent thought circuits. They will continue to ponder and explore their origins until the ever-present mechanical sun completely burns out."

The ring system with dense square holes pierced up from the back of the planet. Everything the planet supports was situated on the strip, revolving quietly with the engine as its axis, day after day.

Until the super-ecosystem collapsed entirely, the equations remained unfalsifiable.\\n\\nHe swirled the fine glass of machine oil, never taking his eyes off the ring that recorded the truth of the planet. The giant screen-like perforated belt was tireless, and the rectangular array filtered the late-night moonlight. Screwllum couldn't stop thinking. <i>Do ends to recursions really exist?</i> He thought. <i>What is the nature of inorganic life — or yet, what is the origin of the universe?</i>\\n\\n<i>Am I really willing to be only a witness to the ideas of my predecessors?</i>\\n\\n\"No,\" Screwllum concluded.

The lack of sunlight in the undergrowth of the rainforest throughout the year creates a perfect space for fungi and other low-light plants to grow. Intelligent creatures inhabited regions near the tropics. Plants, irrespective of height, would grow naturally here.

With time, all those yellowish and translucent oval-shaped fruits grew larger and heavier, hanging down from the branches until the stems could no longer bear their weight. When the time came, fruits would fall to the ground with a loud and crisp sound, cracking their thin skin and releasing whatever was held within. The fauna of Vonwacq was all born this way, be it fish, birds, or polar bears.

To fight for sixty years of peace, they seemed determined, ready to make the ultimate sacrifice, one where they may never return home.\\n\\nAs the war went on, the outsiders discovered the truth about the \"Demon King\" — It was a species of interstellar worm that had once been considered extinct. It was simply unexpected that these creatures would appear in such a form in this corner of the universe.\\n\\nWhen the brutal expedition was finally over, the surviving few natives left the coastline with news of their victory, while the curious outsiders quietly stayed behind. They pushed aside the drooping branches of the giant tree and sank into the quagmire, almost half-submerged. In the sunken lands of the rainforest, the outsiders found a control cabin. It was then that the secret of Vonwacq was finally revealed — the Thestang tree turned out to be the eco genesis system from a much higher civilization, which could decode and then release innumerable life forms to restore the planet's biosphere.\\n\\nThe demon king that cyclically rampaged the planet turned out to be just one single piece of data in the vast biologic database. The outsiders deleted the data of the demon king and then left Vonwacq, not seeking any credit or gratitude from the locals.\\n\\nThe sound of tidal waves battering against the seaside land was the only audible sound on the coastline of Wacq Island. The indigenous coalition forces of Vonwacq were all lined up and were convinced that the demon king would never come again. Then they cheered, toasted, sang, and talked all night about a future without demon kings. However, almost immediately after the two allied tribes bid farewell and returned to their respective homelands, the two tribes began plotting wars for their takeover of the whole of Vonwacq... Without a common threat such as the demon king, their alliance was but a non-binding piece of paper. The small planet was never designed to withstand a conflict between the two tribes. And the short-lived, fragile peace had since shattered out of existence.\\n\\nThe coastline of Wacq Island remained in its enigmatic calm as if nothing had ever transpired on these shores. With humans and Wacqwacq gone from its center stage, Vonwacq had finally reclaimed peace and completed its ecological restoration."

On this tiny planet, mountains of carbon fiber and stainless steel traced the pre-decommissioned outlines of giant ships, casting a shadow of emptiness over the steel ruins. Out here, the exiles' desire to be recalled intensified to a boiling point. Assessors wearing propulsion equipment fought for high-quality parts below-deck for many years, their lightning-fast figures mutually fleeing from and in pursuit of each other in the corridors of sunken ships. They had formed their own underground rules in the shadows... And yet none of these trapped beasts had their wishes fulfilled. No one was ever able to return.\\n\\nThe rules established by these abandoned humans, reduced to caged animals, did not escape the IPC's surveillance. Footage from their wearable cameras were transmitted back to the IPC and passed as after-dinner laughingstock by the high and powerful. The investor of the Traditional Project Department, however, scented out the faint possibility for \"entertainment\" after some consideration.\\n\\nWith this new plan, the first competition in the cosmos featuring the Taikiyan Roboball would have its glorious debut on planet Taikiyan. Several planet terraforming machines descended to the surface and yanked out the decommissioned spaceships in their entirety, not leaving a single inch of their former shadows behind. The obscure little planet had been transformed by the sport of Roboball, becoming a dazzling athletic hub in the blink of an eye. \"No one will care about its ludicrous beginnings by that time. There will only be pure sportsmanship and high-value commercial agreements.\"\\n\\nThe competition had athletes wearing propulsion equipment and armor, ever-changing three-dimensional race tracks, and physical clashes that sent sparks flying... The attention of the entire cosmos was thoroughly captured the moment the Roboball Competition was announced. From that moment forth, the planet once shrouded in darkness has never again seen a moment of night.\\n\\nBoth the home and visitor teams are evenly matched in the massive stadium, and the vociferous audience fills up the dome in countless multitudes. They roar the names of the team and the players, giving birth to a thunderous cacophony that does not end. Outside the dome, the planet is also bustling with activity as broadcast licenses, exclusive sponsorship, and advertising contracts are fought over in the trading market, while underground betting is rife as excitement and disappointment share the spotlight in equal measure... The inky shade of the night has long been transformed into a silent radium backdrop to the overflowing lights of the stadium.\\n\\nThe Taikiyan Stadium has been bright as day from the moment of its inauguration, and no one even remembers where the begone shadows are now hidden."

It constantly chases alterations of the Phase Flame, increasing the unpredictability of the game through its irregular movements. Sports equipment experts followed that by developing a standard-issue propulsion protective armor for Roboball games, allowing top sport equipment and medical organizations to better demonstrate their quality and ensuring the sustainability of a stable income and safe competition.\\n\\nAnd thus, the Taikiyan Roboball Association was formally established, and the initial version of the Taikiyan Roboball Game Rules was formulated. The game system comprising two teams with seven players each was also established from then on.\\n\\nThe track architects of the Intelligentsia Guild had turned the concept of \"racing\" into a three-dimensional circular track — the standard length of which is <unbreak>2.91</unbreak> kilometers. The flat central area of the track is 5 meters wide, and the curved areas on both sides range from 2 to <unbreak>14</unbreak> meters in width. The Roboball players will fly unidirectionally for several laps on the spacious and bright track, accompanied by the sound of whistling and collision, completing the entire game. According to actual testing, during high-speed travel on the track, disconnected point light sources will connect into lines with the athletes' visual persistence, and several dimly visible lumens will form an exclusive arclight track. Interastral Peace Entertainment invited the wealthy to participate in the league, promising them the exposure their favorite sport deserved. Subsequently, the league clubs were established, and the most talented players were assembled and ready to go.\\n\\nInterastral Peace Media had exclusive broadcasting rights for the event and, with the help of ultraremote sensing technology, they broadcasted the live competition far and wide. The sensory experience of top athletes was also recorded throughout the event, allowing homebound viewers to also experience the speed, collisions, whistles, and arclights of the competition from the comfort of their own homes. The old scuttling site was filled with sightseeing cruises and bustling crowds gathered in the streets, illuminated by lights and advertisements, slowly streaming into the stadium. They confirmed their seats, looked around, and were greeted with banners, flags, and airborne malt foam.

At the end, its full form was revealed — It was a grand palace, a heavenly wonder beyond even the combined skill of all of Insumousu's greatest artisans. It descended slowly, as if it had condensed from the heavens themselves. Insumousu's ocean was vast, but could it truly contain this celestial palace fallen from the skies? No one knew for certain.\\n\\n\"Amidst the chaos, some dispersed and fled in all directions. Others remained in the villages on land and under the sea, anticipating the descent of the Divine Fall.\"\\n\\nThe fallen Xianzhou Daiyu crashed onto the surface of Thalassa, leaving a deep watery crater in the heart of the Insumousu sea. For seven planetary days, the world trembled, while the magnificent ruins stood silently on the sea bed like the tragic and magnificent remains of a god. The survivors of Insumousu, living in their abodes in the sea bed, witnessed how their beloved homes were shattered by the celestial palace from beyond. Yet, with joy and elation, they soon found a new home in the remnants of the Daiyu after the Divine Fall.\\n\\nAs living conditions improved, the people of Insumousu had more time and energy to think. They finally had the opportunity to ask the most important questions as they gazed upon the magnificent ruins that descended from the heavens: Who were \"they\"? And from whence did \"they\" come?\\n\\nIn the days of old, the people of Insumousu knew not the art of metallurgy, nor had they yet invented written language. Thus, they turned to imagination to supplement their knowledge, and sought to understand all through the telling of stories. \"Legends\" were born as stories passed through the generations, turning into \"myths\" over time. \"Myths\" then shaped cognition as they themselves endure the flow of time — until \"civilization\" was born. As centuries passed and stars shifted in the sky, Thalassa became a trade partner of the Xianzhou Alliance. It was then that the aquatic people of Insumousu set foot inside the \"celestial palace\" for the first time. There, they beheld the complete grandeur of the Xianzhou, and at last learned the truth behind the Divine Fall.\\n\\nThe well-educated Insumousu gentry always regarded themselves as a continuation of the Daiyu. \"What the Daiyu once followed, we should follow. What the Daiyu once fought against, we should also fight.\" When they tell stories from the past, they would still begin with these words:\\n\\n\"Once upon a time, the palace of the gods fell from the heavens.\""

Insumousu's poets thus sing: \"The ocean may swallow mortals, yet their spirits live on forevermore.\"\\n\\nIn accordance with the calendar of Insumousu, the second day of rest in the Month of Tides is Divine Fall Day — when the water dwellers recite scriptures, consume herbs, and perform bizarre dances along the current in honor of the fallen \"gods\" who brought a blessing to Insumousu. In modern times, Divine Fall Day gradually lost its original religious meaning — songs replace scriptures, delicacies replace herbs, and only the peculiar dances remain to this day as a cultural heritage.\\n\\nIn the past few hundred Star Calendar years, Insumousu has been generous in sharing its unique culture with the outside world, and the form of Divine Fall Day has quietly undergone more changes.\\n\\nInsumousu's land cities are usually full of young people, prone to staying up all night singing and dancing during Divine Fall Day. Foreign visitors, especially Xianzhou tourists, often choose to join in the festivities. Foreigners frequently fall in love with the vibrant atmosphere of the cities, these places filled with fiery passion as unstoppable as tsunamis. As the water dwellers grow out of their adolescent years, their lungs would gradually shrink, their necks metamorphose into gills, and their hands, feet, and eyes become more suited for underwater life. The poets always say, \"The people of Insumousu give their noisy and boisterous youth to the land, and their quiet and solemn old age to the ocean.\"\\n\\nWith the support of Xianzhou's Celestial Guild, a new ritual was added to the Divine Fall Day celebration — People would dive into the wreckage of the Xianzhou Daiyu to search for the remains of Xianzhou humans, then inter them into starskiffs and launch the skiffs into the star of the Thalassa system.\\n\\nThrough their discovery of the history of the Daiyu, the people of Insumousu also learned of the tragedy behind its fall. When the Xianzhou Daiyu was irreparably damaged and breaking apart, Qingzhu, leader of the Daiyu, made the courageous decision to sacrifice herself and the entire ship to end the curse of the immortality plague. The Xianzhou Alliance hopes that the fallen heroes will receive a dignified soul-soothing ceremony and the people of Insumousu, who were spared from the disaster, have given their response.\\n\\nAt some point during the night of Divine Fall Day, the revelry would come to an abrupt halt. Adolescents, children, and Xianzhou residents would sit by the shore as adults emerge from the water and solemnly gaze at the oceanic horizon. Then, several starskiffs break through the water and fly from the bottom of the sea toward the star.\\n\\nThe starskiffs are each inscribed with a row of beautiful Insumousu calligraphy that reads, \"You should undo the ropes for drowned sailors. Don't cry. You can sail safely after my demise.\""

Glamoth's armies fought and failed, again and again... Colonies were scattered, and the proud iron fleet fell one after another. Besieged by the monsters with compound eyes and sheathed wings, the cries of the people of Glamoth were drowned out by despair, and the Welkin Empire was shattered from then on.\\n\\nUntil one day knights clad in mechanical armor descended from the sky and wiped out the sun-swallowing Swarm. Since then, the silver-white iron knights have traveled to and from the various star systems in the empire, crossing the devastated territories and fighting back against the calamity that wiped out the galaxy. They were like warriors born to fight the Swarm.

Under the Empress' command, Glamoth's Iron Cavalry charged across the skies, finally stemming the tide of enemies and bringing a moment of respite to the empire.\\n\\nBut in the never-ending battle against their archenemy, the empire started becoming more and more like its adversary — more and more Iron Cavalry flew high into the sky, blotting out the heavens just as the Swarm did on that fateful day. The look people cast on the Empress and the cavalry turned to one of fear, a fear akin to what they felt toward the Swarm. Perhaps one day the empire would attain the victory it so desired. But on that day, will Glamoth still be a paradise for humanity to rest in?\\n\\nThe Iron Cavalry Regiment formed the last line of defense at the border of Glamoth, where the battle raged on endlessly.

Guests from other lands defy gravity and walk on walls. Strange toys come to life and roam the streets in celebration. The water from the spring turn into a giant whale and swim through the halls. Opening a window no longer show a view of the stars in the deep sky, but of the city's shifting streams of light and shadows, holding up the constant echoes of giant clocks and theaters. The guests finally realize that they were never awake, but are instead witnessing Penacony's true nature in a dream — a place where time stops in a neverending dreamscape.\\n\\nEveryone knows that, under the rule of \"The Family,\" the doors of Penacony are open to everyone amidst the stars.

The star-studded hotel is the jewel of dream weavers, the kingdom of dream makers, and the playground of dream seekers.\\n\\nFew guests are aware of the dusty history of the past — the thread that weaves the dreams comes from reality. The velvety splendor of today's Penacony was born of salty rust, heavy shackles, and deprived freedom. The Planet of Festivities was once an IPC prison, where countless inmates were relocated to salvage the overflowing Memory Bubbles for the Garden of Recollection. People repeated their endless toils until their bodies were as heavy as lead, but their souls became as light as bubbles. At some unknown point in time, the small cells cut off access to reality, but people's consciousnesses became linked in dreams. In the midnight bell, that shared dream seemed so real, reflecting the sheer hypocrisy of reality.\\n\\nIt lasted until the Destruction melted the chains of the IPC, the Trailblaze connected this frontier to the other stars, and the Harmony arrived upon invitation to sow the seeds of peace. Freedom finally broke ground and added a new name to the original dream — Penacony.\\n\\nToday, there is no trace of the crumbling prison. In the dream world, a myriad of skyscrapers has been erected and the desert has been rebuilt and transformed into a metropolis — a new world for dreamers in search of wealth and opportunities, and a utopia for those in search of indulgence and pleasure. The past of the Planet of Festivities is like a photo that fell to the bottom of a cupboard — it exists, but is seen by no one.\\n\\nNowadays, the land of dreams is filled with songs of joy, and the noise of the past have been relegated to gossip, silently lost in the interlude of a comedy, in the behind-the-scenes of some cartoon, or in the side column of some magazine."

However, few remember that the Spheroids are actually imprisonment cages — the vehicle towards dreams are tools originally used for locking up prisoners.\\n\\nA long time ago, the IPC sent a huge number of prisoners to the Asdana star system in an attempt to stop a catastrophe from spreading. There, people reclaimed memoria, gradually becoming lost between fantasy and reality. The spherical work chambers in vacuum became an unforgettable \"memory\" for the prisoners — the hard curved interior walls, the awful experience of tumbling around, the unbearable daily attendance — perhaps these pains ran too deep. When those who regained their freedom pioneered the barren dreamscape, the spherical cages came along with them.\\n\\nBut now, unlike in the past, peace and freedom have given birth to optimism. Instead of trying to destroy the inescapable nightmares over and over, it is better to add to them the color this place should have, to take them in, and embrace them. So, the spherical imprisonment cages of the past have become today's Spheroids.\\n\\nIn the present, the fast-moving colorful Spheroids moving all over Penacony and the slight reverberations coming from within them... are all quietly hidden in the light of the dream city, blending in with the ambitions and laughter, like a land of dreams where time forever stands still."

			"When discussing Oswaldo Schneider, the head of the IPC's Marketing Development Department, people often focus on the decisive operations he undertook upon assuming the position. Within just two years, this young fanatic conquered the bitter cold, pestilence, and death, and managed to address three major longstanding issues that had plagued the Department for several Amber Eras. One of these challenges is the desolate planet known as Sigonia-IV, which is covered in barren deserts and scarred by clan vendettas... a place of harsh conditions and strife.\\n\\nSituated near the convergence of three major star clusters, Sigonia-IV has long been subjected to stellar winds from multiple stars, earning its reputation as the \"eye of the storm\" throughout the Cosmos. The planet's surface environment is extremely harsh, leading many civilizations to either migrate to other celestial bodies or succumb to natural disasters. Now, only a small number of intelligent races remain there, referred to as Sigonians by scholars from the Intelligentsia Guild.\\n\\nIn reality, Sigonians have fragmented into numerous clans, with most adopting nomadic lifestyles, while a few have established centralized systems of governance of reasonable size.\\n\\nThey share a common language. Through the translation provided by the Synesthesia Beacon, you will learn that \"Katica\" means \"shellslasher,\" who have a reputation of being the most ferocious clan among Sigonians. And \"Avgin\" means \"honey,\" who are often accused of pilfering by those willfully ignorant. These clans share a vendetta that lasted through Amber Eras, engaged in a cycle of bloody vengeance in the boundless wilderness where only the fittest survive — until mysterious figures clad in black descended from the sky. From there, Sigonians were briefly united under the radiance of Amber, and the natural cycles that were finally reached a temporary conclusion.\\n\\nAfterward, under the IPC's guidance, the Sigonians established the Sigonian Sovereignty according to the Interstellar Peace Charter and took their first steps toward the wider Cosmos.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this unity and progress did not extend to the Avgins and Katicans. Some malicious opportunists among the Sigonians viewed the former's resourcefulness with suspicion, while slandering the latter as nothing more than predators with no hope of enlightenment. Although they possessed only limited knowledge about Preservation, they understood that some of them had to be sacrificed for it. Utilizing a highly advanced set of parliamentary rules, these devious and corrupt individuals banished both clans to the endless desert.\\n\\nAs a token of apology, they even went out of their way to declare that \"the Avgins shall forever retain the right to autonomy\" — In other words, should any future conflicts occur between the two clans, they could justifiably and lawfully sit back and do nothing."

It's a conventional term irretrievably lost in the long arc of cosmic history.\\n\\nThe Avgins are blessed with attractive facial features, beautiful eyes, and an innate wealth of emotional intelligence, all of which effortlessly endear themselves to any strangers. However, these inborn talents are the exact reason they draw jealousy and ire from others. And the envious and snobbish soon begin their ceaseless slander, and the baseless defamation of the Avgins thus spreads like wildfire throughout the cosmos. As mere rumors can suffice to tarnish the sanctity of truth, the Avgins, a people of a peripheral world, found themselves assailed without recourse, subject to all manners of suspicion and prejudice.\\n\\nThe Avgins have an appreciation for intricately patterned fabrics, as well as a penchant for jewelry crafted from precious gemstones. They're particularly fond of turquoise meteorites, the only kind of gemstones capable of rivaling the resplendence of Gaiathra Triclops' divine body, which in their mythology is believed to have been reborn from death.\\n\\nKnown as Fenge Biyos, their Mother Goddess reigns over all matters related to fertility, travels, and trickery. Depictions of the Mother Goddess in the Avgins' religion often portray her as a left palm adorned with three eyes. The Avgins primarily express reverence for her through spoken prayers alone, believing that the Mother Goddess is as silent and unassuming as the mountains of Sigonia, and that crafting statues or composing hymns for her would only distance themselves from her protective embrace.\\n\\nThe Avgins view the world through the body of the Mother Goddess — the earth, the mountains, and all that exists on the land are a part of the Mother Goddess' divine body. And at the end of each calendar year, her divine body will perish.\\n\\nOn that significant day, her divine essence ascends as a resplendent aurora in the night sky and is reborn in the following day. Hence, Avgins celebrate the first day of the new year through their grand festival called \"Kakava.\" During this festival, they weave sacrificial vessels known as \"Knots of Cyclicality\" and toss them into bonfires to commemorate the Great Goddess' birth.\\n\\nAccording to the incident report by the Marketing Development Department, that shocking conflict took place on a night of Kakava. It was a stormy night when the clouds and fog engulfed the northern lights, which should have been seen as an ill omen. However, the Avgin people were unexpectedly excited. When questioned about this, a maiden from the clan provided the following response.\\n\\n\"Rain is a gift from the Mother Goddess. She is calling to us, urging us to take up arms and fight for our future.\"\\n\"This rain accompanies us. This rain protects us. It is in this rain that we shall meet our honorable demise.\""

Those who looked down named the land below \"Izumo.\" Those who looked up named the world above \"Takamagahara.\" One day uninscribed in the annals, the Yaoyorozu no Kami descended from Takamagahara. These demonic beasts named Kami overturned the skies, burned the rivers and oceans, and shattered the land — People realized in horror that it was not an invasion for rulership, dominance, or plunder. The evil Kami came only to kill.\\n\\nAs the planet stood on the brink of death, Izumo embarked on a Kami-slaying journey, exhausting the might of the entire country to slay the calamity named \"Sovereign of Revelation\" and forging the very first Edict Edge using its bestial body. Giving the Kami a taste of their own medicine, the wielder of these swords can recite the mantra contained within the blade to master the divine power of Takamagahara, and use it to combat the evil Kami and save the masses. From then on, Izumo started its long and arduous crusade, exchanging inordinate lives lost for the fall of one Kami after another, shattering countless mortal blades to forge the twelve Sentinels.\\n\\nIn the merciless fight for survival, Izumo used the might of the Edict Edges to light up their uncivilized world of darkness in less than ten Amber Eras, building cities of dazzling neon lights. That distant Takama Divine Realm, once so far away, became so close within their reach — Yet history suddenly stopped there. The existence of the two planets instantly evaporated, disappearing into nothingness.\\n\\nNowadays, the past of the border planet Izumo can only be gleaned from the scattered whispers in the universe. Academics hold various views regarding its disappearance, but none can solve the mystery. Izumo's history should have been a long flowing river, but it was severed in one cut, and all its past and future voided on emptiness' other shore. Did it never exist, and was it no more than a fabricated story? Did its histories never occur, and it ran aground on the beach of reverse causation? Was it yet another appalling experiment by Dr. Primitive, or was it a sign of the Voracity returning from the end of the Cosmos?\\n\\nOnly that pitch-black great sun knows the answer, yet THEY remain silent, never speaking.\\n\\nBecause everything that had happened will one day regress to the end, and everything that had ended is guaranteed to happen again. The universe undergoes an eternal recurrence under THEIR shadow, and Izumo is nothing more than the footnote for an ellipsis."

			"The beginning of ancient foxian and borisin ballads all nostalgically sing of the \"Planet of Verdantia\" and its fertile soil and pleasant climate. However, upon closer inspection, the perceptive ones will realize such words are mere preludes to the eternal theme of \"war.\"\\n\\nWith their talents for agriculture and commerce, some fox clans built prosperous towns next to flowing rivers. Meanwhile, the children of wolves roamed with their herd under the aurora-covered sky within the lush grasslands, forming settlements that dotted the landscape. The merchants laughed at the herders for the latter's savagery, while the herders despised the merchants for their deception. However, they both must confront the cruel torments of nature — the \"Vulpesummer\" and \"Lupuswinter.\"\\n\\nIn the summer of rich harvests blessed by the fox deity, the two clans put down their arms and ceased warfare in mutual satisfaction. But once the wolf deity lets fall the white frost, the snowlines would spread from the poles and hunger shall drive the two clans to unceasing conflict.\\n\\nThe ballads mention that the Lupuswinter once stayed far beyond its due, even after the sun of Verdantia had circled the planet thirty-three times. Poverty and hunger crashed the people, and they resorted to even eating animals they once worshipped as totems. After foreseeing the end where the entire world shall be covered in bleak death, a savior climbed to the peak of the tallest mountain in that world — The foxian legends called her \"Tushan,\" but the borisin sagas called him \"Duran.\" No matter what this savior was called, they made a wish to the Master of Immortality, hoping for sustenance enough to keep the world's people alive. Then, the mountains split, and sweet divine nectar of Redspring poured out from the hilly ravines.\\n\\nThose who drank from the Redspring obtained power, dexterity, and strength from the beast meat they devoured. Their blood, too, stirred with the ferocity of animals, and their bodily forms became increasingly bestial — Thus was this world changed, never to return to its former days.\\n\\nWith the Redspring as the medium, everything that the reborn canine races needed was made from this miraculous source — The fields no longer grew grain but viscorpi instead, and the garments that covered people's bodies were no longer of linen but of embryonic flesh. Even the chilly snowlands that once terrified the Verdantia civilizations were no longer a concern, for the canine races cultivated biological membranes in the polar regions to craft into warm dome-shaped tents, blocking the impoverished Lupuswinter beyond this barrier.\\n\\nThen, things changed in the Planet of Verdantia, just like how things changed for every short-life species that became long-life — There was population explosion, ecological collapse, internal warfare... And no matter how hard the canine races prayed to the Master of Immortality, they never heard another reply. Then, the people understood the truth: Everything that the Master of Immortality could give had been given, and if the people wished to have better lives, they must take more by themselves.\\n\\nGathered around Duran the great Brood Lord, the canine races cast their sight into the sky where the Master of Immortality dwelled. The stars sparkled like a grassland waiting to be conquered with fast steads, and they will bring the \"Lupuswinter\" to the civilizations on those planets.\\n\\nMuch later, their sworn enemies dubbed them \"borisin,\" for it signified \"wolf\" in the vernacular of Verdantia."

This blank bridle would become a book that records the history of their battles throughout their lives.\\n\\nAs soon as the adulthood ceremony ends, the borisin youths must walk into the weapon farm, then pick and tame their first battle mount among the \"mechabeasts\" that have been filtered and bred via gene witchcraft. Mechabeasts that consume the conquered as their feed have astounding agility, perception, and ferocity — Yet they are considered mere sheep when facing against their future masters. As the moonlight stirs the violent blood in their veins, the borisin youths chase and duel against the mechabeasts. Some will die from the beast's kiss — That is the result of cowardice. Some will kill their peers — That is the law of how valiant beasts shall be distributed... The borisin youths trip the desired mount to the ground and tie the bridle, which is inlaid with neural spike whips, onto the animal's neck — The beast will be stunned through telepathy with its future master and become as tame as if they already received hundreds of whiplashes. When the beast willingly carries the master on its back, a fitting borisin sorya (warrior, rider) will have been born.\\n\\nThen, the borisin bridle will become the recorder of wars, and the reins will gradually become full of scratches, knots, and accessories.\\n\\nThe well-trained sorya dons jellyfish-like membranous armor under the leadership of a yonda (leader, centurion). They then board the beast ships that can warp between stars, explore different worlds, and swear in the name of Duran and the Master of Immortality to make the stars into their herding ground. On the bridle, light scratches indicate how many enemies the owner had slain, knots record how many major campaigns they were involved in, and the accessories dangling from the reins are loot such as human teeth and Intellitron cores obtained from pillaging frenzies... They are the vengeful wails of the conquered, as well as medals for borisin individuals to demonstrate their strength.\\n\\nWhen the mounts beneath the warrior perish in warfare, or when borisin wish to mete out punishment, the bridle can also be fastened around the bodies of other living beings.\\n\\nTheir targets are usually foxians — The slave race excluded from the clan due to genetic selection plans. They are weak, devious, and are only fit for lowly labor and calculations. Whenever rare war-like individuals emerge among the foxians, the master of the wolf-head would prioritize binding these foxians with the bridles, driving them as war slaves to serve as vanguards on the battlefield.\\n\\nIf all slaves are dead, and the weapons are bent, then the bridle can still act as a whip if one attaches a spike to the end. If the bridle is snapped and the warrior perishes in war with their fangs and claws shattered, then the bridle will become the sole remaining epitaph and memories for borisin...\\n\\nJust as the old tales said that \"the position between the predator and prey often changes in the forest,\" countless wolf-kind bridles have been broken and snapped after fighting for millennia against the Xianzhou in this dark forest called the universe. In the end, this link that connects various clans is severed by the sharp arrow of The Hunt, and the borisin also fall into the shadow of internal strife and general decay, becoming ever more removed from their former pride."

			"The Xianzhou Zhuming had floated in the starry seas for over eight millennia after setting sail from the Primeval Imperium. If one were able to view a chronological snapshot of how the starship's form had changed, it would be a very romantic experience — The colossal ship swallowed a deep-blue star, peeled off the worn hull layer by layer, swelled as a brimming bud, and finally bloomed into a lotus.\\n\\nFrom space, the entire Xianzhou Zhuming appears as a lotus lantern of filigree gold. The giant glowing \"lotus leaves\" gradually spread out around the \"light poles\" and are bathed in a soft blue glow, being indeed worthy of poems that declare it \"A ship whose hull deceives the eyes, a lotus whose petals like candles glow.\" The \"lampstand\" section at the center of the ship is a spherical cage, its size on the magnitude of a celestial object. It tightly wraps around the azure sun, the \"lantern wick,\" and eternally spins. This mega structure is the most important location for the Xianzhou Zhuming's manufacturing industry — the Flamewheel Forge.\\n\\nIn the past, the Zhuming Grand Artisan Yang Di had received a weapon mold from the anonymous sovereign of the Primeval Imperium as a gift when the fleet set off on their voyage. Thousands of years later, though the fleet has now changed beyond recognition with their immortality and the return voyage will never occur, the tradition of the Grand Artisan never died. In the Xianzhou Zhuming, artisanship is the supreme school of learning. All its generals also held the title of the Artisanship Commission's Furnace Master. When they leave the ship, they command thousands of troops. When they return to the ship, they would swing their hammer and forge wondrous items, and receive the people's supreme respect. More than half of the weapons used in the Xianzhou's hunts throughout the fleet's history were forged in the Xianzhou Zhuming. Therefore, the Flamewheel Forge came to be regarded as the holy pilgrimage site for such technologies in the entire Cosmos.\\n\\nMetalsmithing is a measure of the advance of civilizations, while flames mark the beginning of civilizations. Many civilizations, while in their infancy, are most troubled with the problem of energy sources. The people would spare no effort in discovering energy sources that can support their civilization to new heights. The Xianzhou Zhuming have stepped over this limitation — By imprisoning the progenitor of heliobi, the Flint Emperor, the artisans have obtained a literally inexhaustible power source. The Flamewheel Forge has intricate branch-like track systems that cover the star as much as possible, and the delicate boughs and leaves are choked with receptors and transmitters that guide the Primordial Flame \"Flint Emperor\" to provide energy for all technological developments.\\n\\nCountless artisans regard the Zhuming Artisanship Commission, which had swallowed up a Pseudo Sun, as the hallowed hall of the craft, with apprentices who aspire to forge divine tools swarming the institution. With enough force, anything can be crafted, and the Flamewheel Forge has prepared everything the artisans could possibly need —\\n\\nApprentices from different worlds come together before the Forge and become fellow students, then compete and share their skills. Outworlders who come in search of marvelous tools would also pay a hefty sum to commission artisans to craft otherworldly items — However, the countless apprentices over the millennia have rarely been favored by General Huaiyan, the \"Artisan of Artisans.\" Whenever he tutors students himself and personally passes on his skills both as a craftsman and a soldier, these students would either become grandmasters who leave a mark in the annals as Furnace Masters or become Cloud Knights with names that thunder through the Alliance such as the Flamewheel Octet.\\n\\n\"Forges wrought a million stars bright, irons craft heroes' soaring flight. Miniscule lights into martial might made, only with sharp blades are peace and plenty saved.\" From the day a Zhuming artisan receives their tools, they must always remember — What they will spend their days and nights making are no simple weapons, but the arrows carrying the creed of The Hunt."

The Flamehunt Judges of the Zhuming Ten-Lords Commission then capture these naive heliobi that have not had any contact with emotions, using kind and gentle dreams to tame the immature temperaments of such flames. Then, the judges pass these harmless heliobi to the Artisanship Commission's Temperaflame Office, which matches the heliobi with various artifacts to make them into lamps, vehicles, and various spectacles in Zhuming... However, in the eyes of confused outworlders, these talking and walking items are proof of the rumor that \"divine essence exists everywhere in the delves, and items would become demons once they are old enough\"...\\n\\nFollowing the alien-colored light band, one can walk deeper past the Forge and arrive at the hypergravity field created by the Pseudo Sun. Mortals struggle to endure a stellar density of this degree. It is an inwardly collapsing disorder that only Ribhus artisans can traverse with ease.\\n\\nThe scorching stellar surges and abnormal celestial phenomena prevent the curious from continuing to approach the Pseudo Sun. All fundamental physical laws of the universe have been amplified in this space. Only one stout and powerful stellar race, the Ribhus, can survive in spaces with such gravitational abnormalities — The Ribhus are natural-born elite artisans. They pass between the Forge and the Pseudo Sun, and their perception of time has long strayed from that of normal beings. They keep their promise and continue to improve their artisanship, forging the ship's enormous cannons and keeping watch over the Pseudo Sun's slumber. The Xianzhou Zhuming regards Ribhus as loyal allies, respecting their tenacity and strength, while being grateful for their selfless sacrifice.\\n\\nAnd yet, no being can follow the light bands further across the outlandish and twisted gravity field to dive deep into the Pseudo Sun. That is a place forbidden to all beings capable of emotion, a room where the endless dream of the Flint Emperor floats — The Xianzhou Zhuming is always on watch, for even the smallest sliver of emotional disturbances can awaken the boundless might of the heliobi progenitor.\\n\\nThere are frequently individuals who ignore the warning and cast their gaze upon the Pseudo Sun from afar. They would unknowingly slip into the psychological gravitational field, and their smallest carelessness would result in their sentience being taken away by the torrential mirages that pour out like a tide. Different from interacting with the gentle illusions, staring upon that \"azure sun\" would only make one feel the boundless rage that has been suppressed since the beginning of time — \"The heliobi shall give the heroes enough power to scorch the very heavens, but when all duties have been fulfilled, the heroes must give to the heliobi supreme bodies forged into perfection...\" No one knows how this ancient oath could be fulfilled. Similarly, none knows when the Flint Emperor would awaken from its bottomless dream.\\n\\nDeep within the lotus lantern's wick, the Pseudo Sun heaves a profound sigh in its unending sleep. The Xianzhou ship slowly sails across the sky, leaving behind only an iridescent trail. In this way, the Xianzhou Zhuming will continue to ally with fire, journey with fire, and share its destiny with that of the fire."

			"Among the multitude of planets with a dearth of liquid water, the pure blue of Lushaka shines prominently among the Przesmir star system. Her seawater resembles the cradle of the mother of oceans. The water nurtures and sustains all life... yet also entraps them, controls them, and ensnares them until there is no more escape.\\n\\nAt the break of dawn, the first mate of the \"stateship\" gently knocks on the Captain's quarters door, and pushes it open. The island ecologies of the Old Era's thirty-seven domains are stuck on the walls all over the cabin. That is how people miss land — meteors from beyond the skies are in the process of covering the entirety of Lushaka with water as if following some single-minded wish. Unending tides bury all ancestral lands in abyssal waters, leaving only an expanse of blue... The first mate rouses the sleeping Captain, for the sea is already glinting specks of gold — the \"stateship\" has begun another day's voyage.\\n\\nThe scouting ship arrives at the center of the plaza. It fires its anchor arrow towards a massive underwater structure that was once a shopping mall. The anchor firmly lodges itself on a window frame — before the diving bell comes, countless startled schools of fish surge forth from the shopping mall's shelves.\\n\\nAfter midday, the scholars leave from the diving bell. They swim past the bookstore, not stopping even for a second — after all, the ink would have long been blurred beyond recognition. Their goal has always been those mediums of shellac or plastic, from which information of past days can be easily obtained after easy cleanup. Deepsea archaeology like this is always arduous. The cleaners stand their ground and watch the vicinity alertly, steel halberds swinging, ensuring that toothy predators are kept at bay. The humans will occasionally collide with deepwater aqua sprites, but both parties are too engrossed in their respective scavenging to pay each other any heed. Instead of shriveled cans, the cleaners are more invested in finding seeds, spices, or liquor.\\n\\nThe intensive underwater investigation is nearing its end as the oxygen reserves decline. Looking back underwater, the giant mackerels have already reached the city. The anxious aqua sprites immediately hold their breath, hug the wall, or hide in secret chambers. They have grown used to utilizing the underwater steel forest.\\n\\nThe drizzle lets up as the sun starts to sink, and the various stateships sound their horns to scatter the plundering seabirds around them. They place the day's harvest on the deck for the stateship's citizens to take what they need. Currents surge at night as the light tower shines crystalline bright. The Luvians dance around the flaming mast, forgetting the tomorrow that will inevitably come, recounting the glories of today with sea shanties, and sighing softly to the halcyon past with medleys. The Captain takes out his compass, gazing toward the direction it points — he knows in that direction lies their home that is growing ever more unfamiliar, where there are still people longing for the return of their kin.\\n\\nAt midnight, the colossal ship extinguishes all its lights, silently adrift upon the sea. Have they truly found peace? Or are their smiles masking the tears that have long dissolved into the sea?\\n\\nAfter tonight, this deep blue will remain unchanged, as it always has."

			"To the aqua sprites, the world above the water was originally unfamiliar and perilous, but that is now no more than a distant memory. After all, things that were once above the water have long been submerged in this deep blue.\\n\\nThe land-dwellers of Lushaka have an intimate yet unfamiliar relationship with the aqua sprites. In deepsea investigations, the land-dwellers view encounters with the aqua sprites as lucky omens, describing the spirits as beautiful and mysterious creatures. Aqua sprites possess navy blue wing membranes and onyx eyes, as well as unique vocal cords capable of producing ethereal sounds. According to stories passed down by mouth among the deepsea investigators, these creatures often accompany sea dragons and reside in a silvery city deep underwater — they exist between reality and legend, embodying serenity and liveliness.\\n\\nHowever, the language used to describe them in the ocean-drowned past was — Edars, monsters of the deep sea.\\n\\nLong ago, the Edars and the land-dwellers fiercely vied for survival. No one could ignore the vivid red the oceans were dyed into. Initially, juvenile Edars were regarded as mere fishing catches. Then, the land-dwellers were lured into the ocean to drown by the songs of the Edars. Both races were hunters and prey for the other in the vast waters. Then came clashes between blades and anchors, as well as battles between sea beasts and cannons. The relentless war, both above and below the water's surface, persisted until the reefs shattered under scorching magma. It was only after a long time that stateship scholars understood that the Cancer of All Worlds has long promised Lushaka's future — only that the promises came from an aqua sprite who lost her home, who cursed the culprit in the nightmare with a silent scream.\\n\\nThe long-forgotten past lies entombed within the steel and concrete coral reefs of the deep sea, as ephemeral as smoke and clouds, known to none.\\n\\nSince then, cities and lands have been swallowed by the sea, disputes and blood have been consumed by the ocean, and history and civilization engulfed by the waves. To escape rising deep-water pressure, the aqua sprites constantly migrate upward, compelled to dwell in cities once home to land-dwellers, prying into memories filled with smiles and tears... They know that few sounds remain on the surface, and the azure now belongs to them alone. Yet, the silence is too overwhelming.\\n\\nWhen the stateship's songsters glimpse azurean silken wings along their nautical course, they will start to sing that beautiful medley...\\n\\n\"They journey along the course, in pursuit of the light tower and storm, seeking only to reclaim that pure blue.\""

Some bananas wake invigorated, baking durians into pies, and frolic merrily in the woods. Some bananas are more solemn, rubbing coconuts on themselves to add some fragrance. The monkey looks upon this lively scene with satisfaction, unable to resist happily calling out to the bananas —\\n\\n<i>\"Are you ready, bananas?\"</i>\\n<i>\"Aye, Principal Monkey!\"</i>\\n<i>\"I can't hear you!\"</i>\\n<i>\"AYE!

The topic on the large banana leaf never changes: \"Do you remember a time beyond the banana?\"\\n\\nThis simple question always results in bitter answers.

Every banana holds a dream within them, striving to become a glorious monkey... As the forest recedes to two sides, Principal Monkey emerges from the middle, offering tender and modest gestures of bowing to the bananas. The bananas return the gesture — Principal Monkey has brought a brand-new game and wishes to \"exchange\" it for new stories.\\n\\n\"Thud. Thud. Thud...\" The noise reverberated <unbreak>11</unbreak> times and a half. The bananas are carried by the monkey back up the tree. As they rock and sway, they return to utopia.

His past was shattered into razor-edged shards, and he forgot even his own name.\\n\\nWandering aimlessly, he drank melted snow to quench his thirst, hunted wild beasts to fill his stomach, and chopped a withered branch to use as a wooden hair-stick to fasten his flowing hair.\\n\\nLike the incessantly flowing stream of a mountain spring, his long, black hair never ceased growing. His flesh twitched and throbbed beneath his skin, like river carps flipping and swarming... Fascinating powers ceaselessly reconstructed his body, bringing an everlasting pain of bones and tendons rupturing and healing. As countless phantom agonies and torments tore through his body, his shattered past was also beginning to come together... As he glanced at his own reflection in the water, the story of that tragedy gradually cleared in his mind.\\n\\nWhen the face in the reflection was no longer a stranger's, the unnamed suddenly realized the dead branch was sprouting flower buds.\\n\\nEpiphany struck him like lightning. The curse of immortality still raged on, and the grudge of past misgivings never died out. HE was now the newborn flower on this once-dead branch."

Countless in quantity, they were difficult to store, and she couldn't be bothered to manage them herself.\\n\\nThe generous and charitable Interastral Peace Corporation then proposed a solution and that was how the Herta Space Station, where wisdom and secrets are stored, was born. Comprehensive containment measures were made throughout the space station, all in the pursuit of organizing everything in the collection with order and clarity. Phenomena were stored in specialized containers while Curios were regulated in indices. Innumerable items were categorized and classified, then stored deep within the station for research.\\n\\nThe IPC then proposed a collaboration in exploring the secrets of the stars together, which brought curious and adventurous scholars into the station to conduct research.\\n\\nMost of them admired Madam Herta, vowing to never abandon their ethereal aspirations and explore the secrets whispered among the stars. They investigated the star systems and realms of living beings, debated true justice in discourses on ethics and philosophies, outlined valleys and peaks within galaxies, deciphered secrets behind religious rituals and ceremonies, held on to the way of seeking truth from practice... They were the true believers of passing knowledge to posterity, and practiced unrestrained and divergent research.\\n\\nHowever, once the space station moved into orbit, it started to operate on its own and Madam Herta rarely showed herself. It was then that the IPC realized the whole station was filled with the mundane daily activities of the researchers, yet the genius was nowhere to be seen.\\n\\nLight from different zones rendered people unaware of the passage of time, the traces of which could only be detected in the burnt out lifestyle in the station. Often a smattering of researchers would argue non-stop about a particular piece of collection, even going so far as to start a fight. Occasionally a security officer would be absent from their daily patrol and nap instead on their military-styled bunker. Sometimes senior researchers would share with their younger peers tales of past romances, while some big shots would disguise themselves as temporary workers to bid their time for the next big turn of luck... Besides research, there was also life. They just had to look outside the hull — for the stars were journeying with them.\\n\\nDespite all the limitations, the researchers still talked about the everyday life in the space station in their own romantic way — The cosmos was a profound epic poem, and Herta Space Station was slowly cracking open the poetry collection."

Madam Herta collected them all when she was in the mood, but would often lose interest once she got her hands on them.\\n\\nHence, though the space station appears to be floating peacefully in space, its treasure hoard of multi-shaped crises hung above it like a sword waiting to fall.\\n\\nSenior researchers had long been aware of the dangers they faced, and understood that \"secrets lie deep within danger.\" They strictly adhere to confidentiality agreements and faithfully carry out regulated containment procedures, thus burying danger within an outward silence... In the cafeteria, they were friends who could joke around. Yet, deep in the bowels of the space station's storage zones, they were highly skilled experts. In this place, secrets would always remain secrets.\\n\\nThe space station is operating as usual in low orbit around The Blue.

			"Thousands of years ago, the Xianzhou Luofu set sail from an ancient nation, crossing deep space to seek an audience with a god in pursuit of the elixir of immortality.\\n\\nThe colossal ship enclosing entire biospheres lumbered into the starry sky like a lucid moon silently falling into the night, embarking on an endless and aimless journey. In this lonely voyage, people slumbered, woke up, and slumbered again in incessant alternation... Star-chasing whales fell from the dome of heaven, and crystalline entities made of subgrain lattice managed to span light years without a single crack. The Elixir Seekers witnessed the majesty of various supernatural powers. In covert delight, they further hardened their resolve to obtain immortality.\\n\\nAfter voyaging for thousands of years, the Xianzhou Luofu gradually came to a halt, whereupon it encountered the master of Abundance in the limbo between the reality and the imaginary. Yaoshi bestowed a divine miracle upon the ship, and it immediately manifested as the Ambrosial Arbor. Its shade was as large as clouds, blocking out the sky and sun. Its roots were thick and dense, enveloping the entire Xianzhou ship — the Luofu seemed to be brought to life.\\n\\nThose who coveted immortality swallowed the fruit of the Ambrosial Arbor, and finally obtained the Endless Lifespan they had dreamed so much about. The Xianzhou residents began to claim they were celestial beings worthy of endless lifespans in abundance, and they also learned to use the Ambrosial Arbor to create various inhuman marvels via the blessings of immortality.\\n\\nYet, just like the shifting of the sun and moon, what once prospered was fated to decline and what once brought elation must eventually induce agony. It was not until the arrival of the Three Sufferings, when people were tormented to near extinction, that the Xianzhou people finally came to understand the true nature of this so-called miracle, which was nothing but harrowing calamity.\\n\\nIn the midst of disaster, a hero rose with the Reignbow and split the Ambrosial Arbor in half. The Xianzhou people regained their dignity as humans, and vowed to return to mortality and purge all deathless doom in this universe. In the ensuing years, Xianzhou went on a hunt across the stellar seas, taking it upon themselves to purge all deathless abominations. The foxians regained their freedom and took back control of the sky, while the Vidyadhara sealed off the contamination and any residual catastrophes. The three races were then brought together in a covenant and coalition. Thus was born the Xianzhou Alliance.\\n\\nProsperity and calamity came and went in cycles during the voyage. Heroes and legends rose to fame and glory one after another as history marched on. Now, the Xianzhou Luofu is healing and reconstructing in a period of hard-won peace. Free trade and open minds truly brought it back to life.\\n\\nImmortality had permanently molded the Xianzhou Luofu. With its ups and downs through history, the Xianzhou Luofu accumulated its own unique aura that combined both antiquity and modernity.

			"The master of Abundance buried the seed of karma in the center of the Xianzhou Luofu and gifted the Elixir Seekers with something named \"Ambrosial Arbor,\" which was considered a miracle as people were able to immediately understand its implications.\\n\\nThe Ambrosial Arbor grew fruits of divinity that brimmed with life and vitality, containing the Endless Lifespan sought by the Elixir Seekers. From that moment, the ancient taboos and laws were rendered useless, and nature's dictum and ethics regarding aging and death became irrelevant history. People followed the way of immortality to exploit the Ambrosial Arbor with increasing intensity, making Fallow Earth that never exhausted itself, molding their own bodies to shapeshift, and giving the gift of thinking and talking to animals... Innumerable unimaginable technologies were brought into existence under the branches of the Ambrosial Arbor.\\n\\nHowever, the Ambrosial Arbor took off its disguise as time went by, revealing its hideous visage as the agony of immortality crept upon the immortals.\\n\\nThe celestials ceaselessly reproduced, yet tasted no death. The ship groaned from overpopulation, as hunger and starvation tormented many. Xianzhou's young can never realize their life's ambitions while their elders clang to power, and society teetered at the edge of structural collapse... Rebellions of the aurumatons and external invasions marked a ruinous millennium, after which the darkness hidden in immortal bloodlines also showed its face. The so-called \"Body of Celestials\" was simply a technology that surpassed human intellect. The propensity to be stricken with mara was a warning to all Xianzhou natives, a reminder that they were a mere step away from becoming abominations themselves.\\n\\nIn desperation, a hero tore through the sky with a powerful shot from their bow, splitting the Ambrosial Arbor in half... Yet even if all there was left of the Ambrosial Arbor was a burnt stump, the fate of Xianzhou could never be separated from it.\\n\\nIt attracted external forces to invade Xianzhou. The Abominations of Abundance launched multitudes of assaults, where flesh was distorted and blood was spilled, for the sole purpose of devouring Xianzhou whole. The Arbor also tempted the Xianzhou residents. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus broke the taboos and ventured deep into the secret of Abundance within the Ambrosial Arbor, hoping to reforge the once mighty immortal empire... In the long days of foreign and domestic troubles, the remaining corpus of the Ambrosial Arbor lurked like unending vines propagating in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to wreak havoc again.\\n\\nFortunately, the Xianzhou Luofu never lowered its guard against the withered tree. The people had vowed to cast this source of all distortions into the end of all things."

Those who claimed to have received the oracle of the god began to act, wishing to help the Aeon Qlipoth to build the wall.\\n\\nThe universe is in imminent peril, and the building of the wall cannot wait. The puny humans had no intention of imitating the feats of the god, instead gathering into a self-proclaimed \"support team\" for the Aeon, willing to devote everything to the Amber Lord. With the power of Preservation, the support team piloted their fleet to different stellar systems to purchase building materials such as stone, wood, gold, and supernium, then tirelessly transported these to the subspace barrier, piling the items on the planetary wasteland.\\n\\nAfter the end of the short development period, the support team took a firm foothold in Pier Point and established the Interastral Peace Corporation. In order to fully carry out their devotion, they turned their sights to deep space.\\n\\nLouis Fleming raised a call for action, and the long-distance trade fleet left the star systems adjacent to Aeon Qlipoth. Their commodities were no longer limited to building materials... They plan to connect the whole Cosmos and trade everything. Soon after, Dongfang Qixing implemented Cosmos-wide trade regulations and built a \"credit\" system to set a price for everything across the universe. Trillions of assets gathered under their megastructure on Pier Point. Like a silent black hole, the building destroyed people's notions about the limits of wealth.\\n\\nToday, the ships of the Interastral Peace Corporation are all over the Cosmos. Despite being criticized as a corporate dictatorship, the IPC has not stopped expanding. They don't care what other people think and have never forgotten their founding mission.\\n\\nThe IPC's recruit training methods change with each passing day, but after nearly eight hundred Amber Eras, there is only one historical practice that never changed. Once upon a time, Louis Fleming, the founder of the IPC, stood in front of the support team and made a passionate speech. He put forward the aspiration of uniting the universe and supporting the Aeon's wishes to protect the universe. As soon as the speech ended, the distant and huge sound of a cosmic impact sounded, injecting a lofty calling into this solemn and sublime moment. From that moment on, they knew this would become their unswerving belief.\\n\\n\"All for the Amber Lord.\""

The two wise ones were determined to delve deeper into the cosmos, and thus the Interastral Peace Corporation was born. The IPC offered anything a planet could ever want, at fair prices pegged to their \"credits.\" Since then, the cosmos's trade route was founded, and all planets that join the IPC's business network can share the same currency, buy the same goods, and enjoy the same services.\\n\\nMerchant ships under the credit system travel between the stars, and the trade routes merge and separate to weave a pan-cosmic network.

The Aeon Qlipoth has no intention of accepting these eager gifts, instead always solely focused on the crisis that will befall the unsuspecting mortals, having to cast the gargantuan barriers measured in light years. The small organization that used to purchase materials has long since become a tremendous influence in the cosmos.

			"Regarding the origin of mechanical life, the carbon-based scholars of the Intelligentsia Guild have a unique speculation: A cluster of electrons born by chance.\\n\\nElectric currents flow throughout the atmosphere and ground. It separated into secondary forms of different magnitudes under the countless acts of gravity and repulsive forces. According to the scholars' hypothesis, this action is tantamount to cell division in carbon-based life. Thereafter, currents randomly output different potentials via the transistor structure naturally formed on the planetary surface, creating the most primitive program. The proud scholars argued that in this way, machines have \"thoughts\" that are comparable to carbon-based life.\\n\\nA mechanic objected to this: How can carbon-based life, which has not even been able to understand the origin of their own beings, have the gall to spout such fallacies? As soon as the words came out, the academic world of the universe was shaken to the core. Mechanical life began to re-examine the arrogant \"carbon-based centrism\" and examine its own origin.\\n\\nHowever, the Screwllumites on the Planet Screwllum had no choice but to pause their march — their planet's energy was being exhausted faster than their inspiration circuits. They needed to first find a way for their population to survive.\\n\\nIn the end, they decided to carry out an extreme plan that transcended several Amber Eras: They used the dying planet as fuel to power the Celestial Differentiator. The awe-inspiring, gigantic gear tirelessly processed the punched tape, methodically repeating calculations. With its planetary energy supply, the huge machine simulated a bona fide and stable superecosystem. They would then build their new home around this parent star.\\n\\nWith their planetary crisis lifted, the Screwllumites could rest. Always rational, optimistic, and elegant, they are determined to explore the answer to their origins in a purely rational manner.\\n\\nThe massive system is filled with the sound of bearings grinding against each other, and the dense teeth of cogs drive the punched tape to churn out data. One branch flows into multiple branches, and countless branches guide trillions of gears to roar... Then, these branches collapse again and again, falling into the furnace and returning to silence in the bubbling core. Over a long period of time, the programmed super-ecosystem gradually became a wonderful and relatively stable one. Eventually, speculations about the origins of machines began to cause Screwllumites' imaginations to wander.\\n\\nThe steel construct that drives the dying star once again activated their intelligent thought circuits.

The ring system with dense square holes pierced up from the back of the planet. Everything the planet supports was situated on the strip, revolving quietly with the engine as its axis, day after day. He had seen the despairingly absurd nature of this planetary system: An elegant string of state transient equations, a giant, icy cylinder — that's all Planet Screwllum is, nothing more.\\n\\nAccording to his interpretation of the equations, at the birth of the Celestial Differentiator, its lead creator tried to explain the origin of the universe as a cellular automaton and its recursion, and Planet Screwllum itself was a result of the game of life.\\n\\nScrewllumites and other inorganic life on the planet acted as the \"cells\" in this automaton, while also being smaller-scale cellular automatons.

They drove violently destructive off-road vehicles and fought for resources with other hordes of bandits in the desert. They created mechanical armor and weapons out of scrap iron and old wires... The more barren the wasteland was, the more freedom they got out of it, like one final frenzy before doomsday. Those sweet dreams were like wisps of nonsense in the radiating heat waves and had long ceased to leave any trace behind.\\n\\nIn a half-awake trance, the thieves came to the realization that the Kingdom of Banditry was never about creation but about destruction."

It had once been neatly lined up on a starship until one hasty escape attempt of the starship led to a huge shock wave, which subsequently exposed the wire to the moisture in the air.\\n\\nThe entire starship was dragged into a labyrinth of underground passages. On the thieves' starship, shields made of steel plates were removed layer by layer, and the power lines were crudely stripped apart, all of which were then used to build the first-ever alliance market. The thieves there began to accumulate wealth and at the same time started to talk about their ideals. Soon after, the protracted infighting began, where suspicion and betrayal were expressed by and against one another. The flames of the war fought between the dictator and their detractors eventually spread from the underground tunnel to the surface-level desert grounds...\\n\\nThis exposed wire was even older. It was dug out of a pothole by the bandits and then connected to a revamped overland vehicle with air leaking in from all directions, which was driven to a distant water source.\\n\\nThe top priority for all survivors of the war of betrayal was to locate Talia's water sources. They drove thousands of miles a day on deserts littered with glass shards in extremely shabby and poorly made vehicles. The caravans of the bandits sometimes chased each other, raising dust and heavy smoke, and other times they just wantonly threw people on or off the car... The sheer pressure of survival forced them to give up all other thoughts. Only by forging ahead could they be saved from confusion.\\n\\nThis naked wire was always old. It was further removed from the overland vehicle and placed into the town's lightbox by the bandits. The aging wire caused the lights to flicker frequently.\\n\\nIt was an old gangster who claimed to be the \"police officer\" who founded the original Nailscrap Town. With his strongarm tactics and charisma, he managed to keep the junkyard in good order. The town became livelier than ever. Eccentric engineers accidentally made machinery out of waste, and desperate wastelanders also enjoyed fighting back and forth in the underground arena... Late at night in a bar, they filled their glasses with grape juice that smelled like gasoline and cheered together, celebrating the fact that they had managed yet another day of survival.\\n\\nThere was nothing new in Talia, just old things repurposed differently in changing times."

			"Vonwacq is a small and crowded planet, almost entirely covered by rainforests and islands, with its exuberant wildlife being its most recognizable feature.\\n\\nVonwacq's effervescent vitality made the rainforests near its equator grow so large and tall that their shades would cover the sky above and even block out the sun. The lack of sunlight in the undergrowth of the rainforest throughout the year creates a perfect space for fungi and other low-light plants to grow. Intelligent creatures inhabited regions near the tropics. Plants, irrespective of height, would grow naturally here. Fresh fruits and vegetables could be picked at any time and anywhere, which was what the locals mostly fed on.\\n\\nHowever, be it the new immigrants or the indigenous Wacqwacq beings, they have always maintained a quasi-religious reverence for the animal fruits growing on the Thestang tree.\\n\\nThe great Thestang tree never stopped bearing fruit, not even for a moment. With time, all those yellowish and translucent oval-shaped fruits grew larger and heavier, hanging down from the branches until the stems could no longer bear their weight. When the time came, fruits would fall to the ground with a loud and crisp sound, cracking their thin skin and releasing whatever was held within. The fauna of Vonwacq was all born this way, be it fish, birds, or polar bears. On Planet Vonwacq, creatures of all kinds shared one common birth mother.\\n\\nThe fiend known as the \"Demon King\" was also born from one such fruit of the Thestang tree. From the moment of its birth, it instinctively knew how to swing its giant ax-like pincers toward others, waging war upon the entire biosphere of Vonwacq.\\n\\nEvery sixty natural years, the Thestang tree would give birth to a new demon king, and the cycle went on and on. The people of Vonwacq had long been used to and prepared for such cyclical fates of doom. Whenever a demon king's awakening approached, they would temporarily set aside their disputes and work together, assembling their strongest warriors to set sail for Wacq Island... One sixty years after another sixty years, these seemingly pointless crusades had been launched over and over again for hundreds of years in such narrow landscapes on this small planet. The demon kings were the permanent disaster of Vonwacq, and the caches of civilization were periodically wiped out.\\n\\nThus, it could be said that Planet Vonwacq was more like a stagnating pool of dead water, even though it was teeming with lively creatures that were ceaselessly fighting with each other, seemingly full of possibilities for change."

Then these creatures awakened, cried, and subsequently left Wacq Island to seek a habitat of their own on Planet Vonwacq.\\n\\nAt first, the outsiders from the stars were seen as reckless thieves who, upon receiving a \"friendly\" tribal welcome, began to understand the civilizational dilemma of Vonwacq. Soon after, the outsiders boarded the locals' boats and sailed to Wacq Island, curious about how a demon king would be born from the fruit. The tribal warriors lay low on the shoals in trepidation, closely clenching their Stone Age weapons. To fight for sixty years of peace, they seemed determined, ready to make the ultimate sacrifice, one where they may never return home.\\n\\nAs the war went on, the outsiders discovered the truth about the \"Demon King\" — It was a species of interstellar worm that had once been considered extinct. It was simply unexpected that these creatures would appear in such a form in this corner of the universe.\\n\\nWhen the brutal expedition was finally over, the surviving few natives left the coastline with news of their victory, while the curious outsiders quietly stayed behind. They pushed aside the drooping branches of the giant tree and sank into the quagmire, almost half-submerged. In the sunken lands of the rainforest, the outsiders found a control cabin. It was then that the secret of Vonwacq was finally revealed — the Thestang tree turned out to be the eco genesis system from a much higher civilization, which could decode and then release innumerable life forms to restore the planet's biosphere.\\n\\nThe demon king that cyclically rampaged the planet turned out to be just one single piece of data in the vast biologic database. The outsiders deleted the data of the demon king and then left Vonwacq, not seeking any credit or gratitude from the locals.\\n\\nThe sound of tidal waves battering against the seaside land was the only audible sound on the coastline of Wacq Island. The indigenous coalition forces of Vonwacq were all lined up and were convinced that the demon king would never come again. Then they cheered, toasted, sang, and talked all night about a future without demon kings. However, almost immediately after the two allied tribes bid farewell and returned to their respective homelands, the two tribes began plotting wars for their takeover of the whole of Vonwacq... Without a common threat such as the demon king, their alliance was but a non-binding piece of paper. The small planet was never designed to withstand a conflict between the two tribes. And the short-lived, fragile peace had since shattered out of existence.\\n\\nThe coastline of Wacq Island remained in its enigmatic calm as if nothing had ever transpired on these shores. With humans and Wacqwacq gone from its center stage, Vonwacq had finally reclaimed peace and completed its ecological restoration."

Out here, the exiles' desire to be recalled intensified to a boiling point. Assessors wearing propulsion equipment fought for high-quality parts below-deck for many years, their lightning-fast figures mutually fleeing from and in pursuit of each other in the corridors of sunken ships.

The investor of the Traditional Project Department, however, scented out the faint possibility for \"entertainment\" after some consideration.\\n\\nWith this new plan, the first competition in the cosmos featuring the Taikiyan Roboball would have its glorious debut on planet Taikiyan. Several planet terraforming machines descended to the surface and yanked out the decommissioned spaceships in their entirety, not leaving a single inch of their former shadows behind.

Another view claims that the Republic of Glamoth was destroyed by how it completely overshot its powerful enemy.\\n\\nIn order to turn the tide in the horrific invasion of the Swarm, the ruling council threw down the gauntlet and resolved to alter the essence of humanity in an effort to adapt to the war — they will create a weapon \"born to fight.\"\\n\\nThe result of all this was \"Titania.\" The Empress, who holds no power, telepathically commands and controls the knights connected to her. In the dreams that these warriors are woven into, the sole meaning of their existence is to guard Titania and her \"empire.\" In their short lives, they studied, fought, received the Empress' commands, faced the enemy fearlessly, and died with honor.\\n\\nNo one knew when this falsehood was revealed. Was it from the day when the old humans in Glamoth's territories fell below a certain percentage? Was it the day when scientists realized that the Empress was beginning to revolt against her captivity? Or... maybe the day when the Swarm's onslaught dissipated into thin air?\\n\\nAll the people knew was that the Iron Cavalry gave their all for the non-existent \"empire.\" After decades of bloody battles, the remains of mechas and insect limbs turned into dense debris strewn throughout Glamoth's segmentum, connecting with each other to form a \"River of Death.\" When the remnants of the Swarm no longer posed a threat and the leaders of the council rang the bell of peace, informing the citizens that they had dispelled the apocalypse that clouded the heavens and the republic would be ushered back into the light of day — What arrived was not daylight, but the beginning of another sunless night.\\n\\nAfter that, the civilization known as Glamoth faded away, and the long-awaited peace came to the empty stars. The long river of stardust and debris flows silently along the void."

			"The attendants bow and salute with uniform smiles, and greet the guests with music: \"Welcome to the Planet of Festivities! Beautiful dreams await you.\" The guests smile as they move forward, accepting their drinks infused full of bubbles and gulping them down.\\n\\nThe scenery gradually becomes more and more incredulous, and the senses feel as if one has been lifted by silk. Guests from other lands defy gravity and walk on walls. Strange toys come to life and roam the streets in celebration. The water from the spring turn into a giant whale and swim through the halls. Opening a window no longer show a view of the stars in the deep sky, but of the city's shifting streams of light and shadows, holding up the constant echoes of giant clocks and theaters. The guests finally realize that they were never awake, but are instead witnessing Penacony's true nature in a dream — a place where time stops in a neverending dreamscape.\\n\\nEveryone knows that, under the rule of \"The Family,\" the doors of Penacony are open to everyone amidst the stars. For a transcendent experience, for an inspirational excitement, for the soothing of worries and wounds — guests of the highest caliber come to surrender their pain in exchange for peace and tranquility, to drink the best of the best, and to wander in the sea of dreams. Some spend unforgettable holidays here and leave content, while others become obsessed with the festivities and settle down here. The star-studded hotel is the jewel of dream weavers, the kingdom of dream makers, and the playground of dream seekers.\\n\\nFew guests are aware of the dusty history of the past — the thread that weaves the dreams comes from reality. The velvety splendor of today's Penacony was born of salty rust, heavy shackles, and deprived freedom. The Planet of Festivities was once an IPC prison, where countless inmates were relocated to salvage the overflowing Memory Bubbles for the Garden of Recollection. People repeated their endless toils until their bodies were as heavy as lead, but their souls became as light as bubbles. At some unknown point in time, the small cells cut off access to reality, but people's consciousnesses became linked in dreams. In the midnight bell, that shared dream seemed so real, reflecting the sheer hypocrisy of reality.\\n\\nIt lasted until the Destruction melted the chains of the IPC, the Trailblaze connected this frontier to the other stars, and the Harmony arrived upon invitation to sow the seeds of peace. Freedom finally broke ground and added a new name to the original dream — Penacony.\\n\\nToday, there is no trace of the crumbling prison. In the dream world, a myriad of skyscrapers has been erected and the desert has been rebuilt and transformed into a metropolis — a new world for dreamers in search of wealth and opportunities, and a utopia for those in search of indulgence and pleasure. The past of the Planet of Festivities is like a photo that fell to the bottom of a cupboard — it exists, but is seen by no one.\\n\\nNowadays, the land of dreams is filled with songs of joy, and the noise of the past have been relegated to gossip, silently lost in the interlude of a comedy, in the behind-the-scenes of some cartoon, or in the side column of some magazine."

			"Those who have visited Penacony will agree that \"built on dreams\" is not just some saying, but is a very real statement. The opulent hotel is just the tip of the iceberg of the Planet of Festivities, and it is only when you \"stay and dream\" that you are considered to have officially arrived at Penacony. From then on, the land of dreams, consisting of twelve dreamscapes, slowly expands before the guests' eyes.\\n\\nGuests who are new to the place may be overwhelmed by this carnival stage, but do not be alarmed. Look up and see the metal tracks crisscrossing the skyscrapers and the Spheroids rapidly rolling along them. They are the most visible means of transportation in this dreamscape metropolis and guide guests to each and every place around the city.\\n\\nStarting from the central station, the complicated Spheroid tracks are like the blood vessels of the metropolis. Whether it is the underground tunnels of the Moment of Daybreak, the vast fields of the Moment of Scorchsand, or the glittering stadium of the Moment of Stars, the colorful Spheroids roll on and on, delivering people to each station accurately, efficiently, safely, and comfortably, pouring a sleepless energy into the dream world of Penacony.\\n\\nDreams give a light and delicate texture to everything, and the nut-like Spheroids are regarded as both vehicles and as toys in the land of dreams. However, few remember that the Spheroids are actually imprisonment cages — the vehicle towards dreams are tools originally used for locking up prisoners.\\n\\nA long time ago, the IPC sent a huge number of prisoners to the Asdana star system in an attempt to stop a catastrophe from spreading. There, people reclaimed memoria, gradually becoming lost between fantasy and reality. The spherical work chambers in vacuum became an unforgettable \"memory\" for the prisoners — the hard curved interior walls, the awful experience of tumbling around, the unbearable daily attendance — perhaps these pains ran too deep. When those who regained their freedom pioneered the barren dreamscape, the spherical cages came along with them.\\n\\nBut now, unlike in the past, peace and freedom have given birth to optimism. Instead of trying to destroy the inescapable nightmares over and over, it is better to add to them the color this place should have, to take them in, and embrace them. So, the spherical imprisonment cages of the past have become today's Spheroids.\\n\\nIn the present, the fast-moving colorful Spheroids moving all over Penacony and the slight reverberations coming from within them... are all quietly hidden in the light of the dream city, blending in with the ambitions and laughter, like a land of dreams where time forever stands still."

Within just two years, this young fanatic conquered the bitter cold, pestilence, and death, and managed to address three major longstanding issues that had plagued the Department for several Amber Eras. One of these challenges is the desolate planet known as Sigonia-IV, which is covered in barren deserts and scarred by clan vendettas... a place of harsh conditions and strife.\\n\\nSituated near the convergence of three major star clusters, Sigonia-IV has long been subjected to stellar winds from multiple stars, earning its reputation as the \"eye of the storm\" throughout the Cosmos. The planet's surface environment is extremely harsh, leading many civilizations to either migrate to other celestial bodies or succumb to natural disasters. Now, only a small number of intelligent races remain there, referred to as Sigonians by scholars from the Intelligentsia Guild.\\n\\nIn reality, Sigonians have fragmented into numerous clans, with most adopting nomadic lifestyles, while a few have established centralized systems of governance of reasonable size.\\n\\nThey share a common language. Through the translation provided by the Synesthesia Beacon, you will learn that \"Katica\" means \"shellslasher,\" who have a reputation of being the most ferocious clan among Sigonians. And \"Avgin\" means \"honey,\" who are often accused of pilfering by those willfully ignorant. These clans share a vendetta that lasted through Amber Eras, engaged in a cycle of bloody vengeance in the boundless wilderness where only the fittest survive — until mysterious figures clad in black descended from the sky. From there, Sigonians were briefly united under the radiance of Amber, and the natural cycles that were finally reached a temporary conclusion.\\n\\nAfterward, under the IPC's guidance, the Sigonians established the Sigonian Sovereignty according to the Interstellar Peace Charter and took their first steps toward the wider Cosmos.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this unity and progress did not extend to the Avgins and Katicans. Some malicious opportunists among the Sigonians viewed the former's resourcefulness with suspicion, while slandering the latter as nothing more than predators with no hope of enlightenment. Although they possessed only limited knowledge about Preservation, they understood that some of them had to be sacrificed for it. Utilizing a highly advanced set of parliamentary rules, these devious and corrupt individuals banished both clans to the endless desert.\\n\\nAs a token of apology, they even went out of their way to declare that \"the Avgins shall forever retain the right to autonomy\" — In other words, should any future conflicts occur between the two clans, they could justifiably and lawfully sit back and do nothing."

However, these inborn talents are the exact reason they draw jealousy and ire from others. And the envious and snobbish soon begin their ceaseless slander, and the baseless defamation of the Avgins thus spreads like wildfire throughout the cosmos. As mere rumors can suffice to tarnish the sanctity of truth, the Avgins, a people of a peripheral world, found themselves assailed without recourse, subject to all manners of suspicion and prejudice.\\n\\nThe Avgins have an appreciation for intricately patterned fabrics, as well as a penchant for jewelry crafted from precious gemstones. They're particularly fond of turquoise meteorites, the only kind of gemstones capable of rivaling the resplendence of Gaiathra Triclops' divine body, which in their mythology is believed to have been reborn from death.\\n\\nKnown as Fenge Biyos, their Mother Goddess reigns over all matters related to fertility, travels, and trickery. Depictions of the Mother Goddess in the Avgins' religion often portray her as a left palm adorned with three eyes. The Avgins primarily express reverence for her through spoken prayers alone, believing that the Mother Goddess is as silent and unassuming as the mountains of Sigonia, and that crafting statues or composing hymns for her would only distance themselves from her protective embrace.\\n\\nThe Avgins view the world through the body of the Mother Goddess — the earth, the mountains, and all that exists on the land are a part of the Mother Goddess' divine body. And at the end of each calendar year, her divine body will perish.\\n\\nOn that significant day, her divine essence ascends as a resplendent aurora in the night sky and is reborn in the following day. Hence, Avgins celebrate the first day of the new year through their grand festival called \"Kakava.\" During this festival, they weave sacrificial vessels known as \"Knots of Cyclicality\" and toss them into bonfires to commemorate the Great Goddess' birth.\\n\\nAccording to the incident report by the Marketing Development Department, that shocking conflict took place on a night of Kakava. It was a stormy night when the clouds and fog engulfed the northern lights, which should have been seen as an ill omen. However, the Avgin people were unexpectedly excited. When questioned about this, a maiden from the clan provided the following response.\\n\\n\"Rain is a gift from the Mother Goddess. She is calling to us, urging us to take up arms and fight for our future.\"\\n\"This rain accompanies us. This rain protects us. It is in this rain that we shall meet our honorable demise.\""

Those who looked down named the land below \"Izumo.\" Those who looked up named the world above \"Takamagahara.\" One day uninscribed in the annals, the Yaoyorozu no Kami descended from Takamagahara. These demonic beasts named Kami overturned the skies, burned the rivers and oceans, and shattered the land — People realized in horror that it was not an invasion for rulership, dominance, or plunder. The evil Kami came only to kill.\\n\\nAs the planet stood on the brink of death, Izumo embarked on a Kami-slaying journey, exhausting the might of the entire country to slay the calamity named \"Sovereign of Revelation\" and forging the very first Edict Edge using its bestial body. Giving the Kami a taste of their own medicine, the wielder of these swords can recite the mantra contained within the blade to master the divine power of Takamagahara, and use it to combat the evil Kami and save the masses. From then on, Izumo started its long and arduous crusade, exchanging inordinate lives lost for the fall of one Kami after another, shattering countless mortal blades to forge the twelve Sentinels.\\n\\nIn the merciless fight for survival, Izumo used the might of the Edict Edges to light up their uncivilized world of darkness in less than ten Amber Eras, building cities of dazzling neon lights. That distant Takama Divine Realm, once so far away, became so close within their reach — Yet history suddenly stopped there. The existence of the two planets instantly evaporated, disappearing into nothingness.\\n\\nNowadays, the past of the border planet Izumo can only be gleaned from the scattered whispers in the universe. Academics hold various views regarding its disappearance, but none can solve the mystery. Izumo's history should have been a long flowing river, but it was severed in one cut, and all its past and future voided on emptiness' other shore. Did it never exist, and was it no more than a fabricated story? Did its histories never occur, and it ran aground on the beach of reverse causation? Was it yet another appalling experiment by Dr. Primitive, or was it a sign of the Voracity returning from the end of the Cosmos?\\n\\nOnly that pitch-black great sun knows the answer, yet THEY remain silent, never speaking.\\n\\nBecause everything that had happened will one day regress to the end, and everything that had ended is guaranteed to happen again.

			"The beginning of ancient foxian and borisin ballads all nostalgically sing of the \"Planet of Verdantia\" and its fertile soil and pleasant climate. However, upon closer inspection, the perceptive ones will realize such words are mere preludes to the eternal theme of \"war.\"\\n\\nWith their talents for agriculture and commerce, some fox clans built prosperous towns next to flowing rivers. Meanwhile, the children of wolves roamed with their herd under the aurora-covered sky within the lush grasslands, forming settlements that dotted the landscape. The merchants laughed at the herders for the latter's savagery, while the herders despised the merchants for their deception. However, they both must confront the cruel torments of nature — the \"Vulpesummer\" and \"Lupuswinter.\"\\n\\nIn the summer of rich harvests blessed by the fox deity, the two clans put down their arms and ceased warfare in mutual satisfaction. But once the wolf deity lets fall the white frost, the snowlines would spread from the poles and hunger shall drive the two clans to unceasing conflict.\\n\\nThe ballads mention that the Lupuswinter once stayed far beyond its due, even after the sun of Verdantia had circled the planet thirty-three times. Poverty and hunger crashed the people, and they resorted to even eating animals they once worshipped as totems. After foreseeing the end where the entire world shall be covered in bleak death, a savior climbed to the peak of the tallest mountain in that world — The foxian legends called her \"Tushan,\" but the borisin sagas called him \"Duran.\" No matter what this savior was called, they made a wish to the Master of Immortality, hoping for sustenance enough to keep the world's people alive. Then, the mountains split, and sweet divine nectar of Redspring poured out from the hilly ravines.\\n\\nThose who drank from the Redspring obtained power, dexterity, and strength from the beast meat they devoured. Their blood, too, stirred with the ferocity of animals, and their bodily forms became increasingly bestial — Thus was this world changed, never to return to its former days.\\n\\nWith the Redspring as the medium, everything that the reborn canine races needed was made from this miraculous source — The fields no longer grew grain but viscorpi instead, and the garments that covered people's bodies were no longer of linen but of embryonic flesh. Even the chilly snowlands that once terrified the Verdantia civilizations were no longer a concern, for the canine races cultivated biological membranes in the polar regions to craft into warm dome-shaped tents, blocking the impoverished Lupuswinter beyond this barrier.\\n\\nThen, things changed in the Planet of Verdantia, just like how things changed for every short-life species that became long-life — There was population explosion, ecological collapse, internal warfare... And no matter how hard the canine races prayed to the Master of Immortality, they never heard another reply. Then, the people understood the truth: Everything that the Master of Immortality could give had been given, and if the people wished to have better lives, they must take more by themselves.\\n\\nGathered around Duran the great Brood Lord, the canine races cast their sight into the sky where the Master of Immortality dwelled. The stars sparkled like a grassland waiting to be conquered with fast steads, and they will bring the \"Lupuswinter\" to the civilizations on those planets.\\n\\nMuch later, their sworn enemies dubbed them \"borisin,\" for it signified \"wolf\" in the vernacular of Verdantia."

This blank bridle would become a book that records the history of their battles throughout their lives.\\n\\nAs soon as the adulthood ceremony ends, the borisin youths must walk into the weapon farm, then pick and tame their first battle mount among the \"mechabeasts\" that have been filtered and bred via gene witchcraft. Mechabeasts that consume the conquered as their feed have astounding agility, perception, and ferocity — Yet they are considered mere sheep when facing against their future masters. As the moonlight stirs the violent blood in their veins, the borisin youths chase and duel against the mechabeasts. Some will die from the beast's kiss — That is the result of cowardice. Some will kill their peers — That is the law of how valiant beasts shall be distributed... The borisin youths trip the desired mount to the ground and tie the bridle, which is inlaid with neural spike whips, onto the animal's neck — The beast will be stunned through telepathy with its future master and become as tame as if they already received hundreds of whiplashes. When the beast willingly carries the master on its back, a fitting borisin sorya (warrior, rider) will have been born.\\n\\nThen, the borisin bridle will become the recorder of wars, and the reins will gradually become full of scratches, knots, and accessories.\\n\\nThe well-trained sorya dons jellyfish-like membranous armor under the leadership of a yonda (leader, centurion). They then board the beast ships that can warp between stars, explore different worlds, and swear in the name of Duran and the Master of Immortality to make the stars into their herding ground. On the bridle, light scratches indicate how many enemies the owner had slain, knots record how many major campaigns they were involved in, and the accessories dangling from the reins are loot such as human teeth and Intellitron cores obtained from pillaging frenzies... They are the vengeful wails of the conquered, as well as medals for borisin individuals to demonstrate their strength.\\n\\nWhen the mounts beneath the warrior perish in warfare, or when borisin wish to mete out punishment, the bridle can also be fastened around the bodies of other living beings.\\n\\nTheir targets are usually foxians — The slave race excluded from the clan due to genetic selection plans. They are weak, devious, and are only fit for lowly labor and calculations. Whenever rare war-like individuals emerge among the foxians, the master of the wolf-head would prioritize binding these foxians with the bridles, driving them as war slaves to serve as vanguards on the battlefield.\\n\\nIf all slaves are dead, and the weapons are bent, then the bridle can still act as a whip if one attaches a spike to the end. If the bridle is snapped and the warrior perishes in war with their fangs and claws shattered, then the bridle will become the sole remaining epitaph and memories for borisin...\\n\\nJust as the old tales said that \"the position between the predator and prey often changes in the forest,\" countless wolf-kind bridles have been broken and snapped after fighting for millennia against the Xianzhou in this dark forest called the universe. In the end, this link that connects various clans is severed by the sharp arrow of The Hunt, and the borisin also fall into the shadow of internal strife and general decay, becoming ever more removed from their former pride."

			"The Xianzhou Zhuming had floated in the starry seas for over eight millennia after setting sail from the Primeval Imperium. If one were able to view a chronological snapshot of how the starship's form had changed, it would be a very romantic experience — The colossal ship swallowed a deep-blue star, peeled off the worn hull layer by layer, swelled as a brimming bud, and finally bloomed into a lotus.\\n\\nFrom space, the entire Xianzhou Zhuming appears as a lotus lantern of filigree gold. The giant glowing \"lotus leaves\" gradually spread out around the \"light poles\" and are bathed in a soft blue glow, being indeed worthy of poems that declare it \"A ship whose hull deceives the eyes, a lotus whose petals like candles glow.\" The \"lampstand\" section at the center of the ship is a spherical cage, its size on the magnitude of a celestial object. It tightly wraps around the azure sun, the \"lantern wick,\" and eternally spins. This mega structure is the most important location for the Xianzhou Zhuming's manufacturing industry — the Flamewheel Forge.\\n\\nIn the past, the Zhuming Grand Artisan Yang Di had received a weapon mold from the anonymous sovereign of the Primeval Imperium as a gift when the fleet set off on their voyage. Thousands of years later, though the fleet has now changed beyond recognition with their immortality and the return voyage will never occur, the tradition of the Grand Artisan never died. In the Xianzhou Zhuming, artisanship is the supreme school of learning. All its generals also held the title of the Artisanship Commission's Furnace Master. When they leave the ship, they command thousands of troops. When they return to the ship, they would swing their hammer and forge wondrous items, and receive the people's supreme respect. More than half of the weapons used in the Xianzhou's hunts throughout the fleet's history were forged in the Xianzhou Zhuming. Therefore, the Flamewheel Forge came to be regarded as the holy pilgrimage site for such technologies in the entire Cosmos.\\n\\nMetalsmithing is a measure of the advance of civilizations, while flames mark the beginning of civilizations. Many civilizations, while in their infancy, are most troubled with the problem of energy sources. The people would spare no effort in discovering energy sources that can support their civilization to new heights. The Xianzhou Zhuming have stepped over this limitation — By imprisoning the progenitor of heliobi, the Flint Emperor, the artisans have obtained a literally inexhaustible power source. The Flamewheel Forge has intricate branch-like track systems that cover the star as much as possible, and the delicate boughs and leaves are choked with receptors and transmitters that guide the Primordial Flame \"Flint Emperor\" to provide energy for all technological developments.\\n\\nCountless artisans regard the Zhuming Artisanship Commission, which had swallowed up a Pseudo Sun, as the hallowed hall of the craft, with apprentices who aspire to forge divine tools swarming the institution. With enough force, anything can be crafted, and the Flamewheel Forge has prepared everything the artisans could possibly need —\\n\\nApprentices from different worlds come together before the Forge and become fellow students, then compete and share their skills. Outworlders who come in search of marvelous tools would also pay a hefty sum to commission artisans to craft otherworldly items — However, the countless apprentices over the millennia have rarely been favored by General Huaiyan, the \"Artisan of Artisans.\" Whenever he tutors students himself and personally passes on his skills both as a craftsman and a soldier, these students would either become grandmasters who leave a mark in the annals as Furnace Masters or become Cloud Knights with names that thunder through the Alliance such as the Flamewheel Octet.\\n\\n\"Forges wrought a million stars bright, irons craft heroes' soaring flight. Miniscule lights into martial might made, only with sharp blades are peace and plenty saved.\" From the day a Zhuming artisan receives their tools, they must always remember — What they will spend their days and nights making are no simple weapons, but the arrows carrying the creed of The Hunt."

			"The Xianzhou Zhuming has always been accompanied by multicolored light bands while voyaging in deep space. These bands are both energy outputs from super-high-temperature fusion reactions, as well as evidence that the Flint Emperor still burns and shall never die.\\n\\nOn the outermost skirts of the aurora-inducing particles dispersed with the Flint Emperor's breaths, newborn heliobi slow down and wander into being. The Flamehunt Judges of the Zhuming Ten-Lords Commission then capture these naive heliobi that have not had any contact with emotions, using kind and gentle dreams to tame the immature temperaments of such flames. Then, the judges pass these harmless heliobi to the Artisanship Commission's Temperaflame Office, which matches the heliobi with various artifacts to make them into lamps, vehicles, and various spectacles in Zhuming... However, in the eyes of confused outworlders, these talking and walking items are proof of the rumor that \"divine essence exists everywhere in the delves, and items would become demons once they are old enough\"...\\n\\nFollowing the alien-colored light band, one can walk deeper past the Forge and arrive at the hypergravity field created by the Pseudo Sun. Mortals struggle to endure a stellar density of this degree. It is an inwardly collapsing disorder that only Ribhus artisans can traverse with ease.\\n\\nThe scorching stellar surges and abnormal celestial phenomena prevent the curious from continuing to approach the Pseudo Sun. All fundamental physical laws of the universe have been amplified in this space. Only one stout and powerful stellar race, the Ribhus, can survive in spaces with such gravitational abnormalities — The Ribhus are natural-born elite artisans. They pass between the Forge and the Pseudo Sun, and their perception of time has long strayed from that of normal beings. They keep their promise and continue to improve their artisanship, forging the ship's enormous cannons and keeping watch over the Pseudo Sun's slumber. The Xianzhou Zhuming regards Ribhus as loyal allies, respecting their tenacity and strength, while being grateful for their selfless sacrifice.\\n\\nAnd yet, no being can follow the light bands further across the outlandish and twisted gravity field to dive deep into the Pseudo Sun. That is a place forbidden to all beings capable of emotion, a room where the endless dream of the Flint Emperor floats — The Xianzhou Zhuming is always on watch, for even the smallest sliver of emotional disturbances can awaken the boundless might of the heliobi progenitor.\\n\\nThere are frequently individuals who ignore the warning and cast their gaze upon the Pseudo Sun from afar. They would unknowingly slip into the psychological gravitational field, and their smallest carelessness would result in their sentience being taken away by the torrential mirages that pour out like a tide. Different from interacting with the gentle illusions, staring upon that \"azure sun\" would only make one feel the boundless rage that has been suppressed since the beginning of time — \"The heliobi shall give the heroes enough power to scorch the very heavens, but when all duties have been fulfilled, the heroes must give to the heliobi supreme bodies forged into perfection...\" No one knows how this ancient oath could be fulfilled. Similarly, none knows when the Flint Emperor would awaken from its bottomless dream.\\n\\nDeep within the lotus lantern's wick, the Pseudo Sun heaves a profound sigh in its unending sleep. The Xianzhou ship slowly sails across the sky, leaving behind only an iridescent trail. In this way, the Xianzhou Zhuming will continue to ally with fire, journey with fire, and share its destiny with that of the fire."

			"Among the multitude of planets with a dearth of liquid water, the pure blue of Lushaka shines prominently among the Przesmir star system. Her seawater resembles the cradle of the mother of oceans. The water nurtures and sustains all life... yet also entraps them, controls them, and ensnares them until there is no more escape.\\n\\nAt the break of dawn, the first mate of the \"stateship\" gently knocks on the Captain's quarters door, and pushes it open. The island ecologies of the Old Era's thirty-seven domains are stuck on the walls all over the cabin. That is how people miss land — meteors from beyond the skies are in the process of covering the entirety of Lushaka with water as if following some single-minded wish. Unending tides bury all ancestral lands in abyssal waters, leaving only an expanse of blue... The first mate rouses the sleeping Captain, for the sea is already glinting specks of gold — the \"stateship\" has begun another day's voyage.\\n\\nThe scouting ship arrives at the center of the plaza. It fires its anchor arrow towards a massive underwater structure that was once a shopping mall. The anchor firmly lodges itself on a window frame — before the diving bell comes, countless startled schools of fish surge forth from the shopping mall's shelves.\\n\\nAfter midday, the scholars leave from the diving bell. They swim past the bookstore, not stopping even for a second — after all, the ink would have long been blurred beyond recognition. Their goal has always been those mediums of shellac or plastic, from which information of past days can be easily obtained after easy cleanup. Deepsea archaeology like this is always arduous. The cleaners stand their ground and watch the vicinity alertly, steel halberds swinging, ensuring that toothy predators are kept at bay. The humans will occasionally collide with deepwater aqua sprites, but both parties are too engrossed in their respective scavenging to pay each other any heed. Instead of shriveled cans, the cleaners are more invested in finding seeds, spices, or liquor.\\n\\nThe intensive underwater investigation is nearing its end as the oxygen reserves decline. Looking back underwater, the giant mackerels have already reached the city. The anxious aqua sprites immediately hold their breath, hug the wall, or hide in secret chambers. They have grown used to utilizing the underwater steel forest.\\n\\nThe drizzle lets up as the sun starts to sink, and the various stateships sound their horns to scatter the plundering seabirds around them. They place the day's harvest on the deck for the stateship's citizens to take what they need. Currents surge at night as the light tower shines crystalline bright. The Luvians dance around the flaming mast, forgetting the tomorrow that will inevitably come, recounting the glories of today with sea shanties, and sighing softly to the halcyon past with medleys. The Captain takes out his compass, gazing toward the direction it points — he knows in that direction lies their home that is growing ever more unfamiliar, where there are still people longing for the return of their kin.\\n\\nAt midnight, the colossal ship extinguishes all its lights, silently adrift upon the sea. Have they truly found peace? Or are their smiles masking the tears that have long dissolved into the sea?\\n\\nAfter tonight, this deep blue will remain unchanged, as it always has."

After all, things that were once above the water have long been submerged in this deep blue.\\n\\nThe land-dwellers of Lushaka have an intimate yet unfamiliar relationship with the aqua sprites. In deepsea investigations, the land-dwellers view encounters with the aqua sprites as lucky omens, describing the spirits as beautiful and mysterious creatures. Aqua sprites possess navy blue wing membranes and onyx eyes, as well as unique vocal cords capable of producing ethereal sounds. According to stories passed down by mouth among the deepsea investigators, these creatures often accompany sea dragons and reside in a silvery city deep underwater — they exist between reality and legend, embodying serenity and liveliness.\\n\\nHowever, the language used to describe them in the ocean-drowned past was — Edars, monsters of the deep sea.\\n\\nLong ago, the Edars and the land-dwellers fiercely vied for survival. No one could ignore the vivid red the oceans were dyed into. Initially, juvenile Edars were regarded as mere fishing catches. Then, the land-dwellers were lured into the ocean to drown by the songs of the Edars. Both races were hunters and prey for the other in the vast waters. Then came clashes between blades and anchors, as well as battles between sea beasts and cannons. The relentless war, both above and below the water's surface, persisted until the reefs shattered under scorching magma. It was only after a long time that stateship scholars understood that the Cancer of All Worlds has long promised Lushaka's future — only that the promises came from an aqua sprite who lost her home, who cursed the culprit in the nightmare with a silent scream.\\n\\nThe long-forgotten past lies entombed within the steel and concrete coral reefs of the deep sea, as ephemeral as smoke and clouds, known to none.\\n\\nSince then, cities and lands have been swallowed by the sea, disputes and blood have been consumed by the ocean, and history and civilization engulfed by the waves. To escape rising deep-water pressure, the aqua sprites constantly migrate upward, compelled to dwell in cities once home to land-dwellers, prying into memories filled with smiles and tears...
