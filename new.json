        "A bronze ballista bolt, as tall as a man, tore through the sea mist wrapped in flames, only to shatter into dust the moment it neared the siren's scaled armor. The pale blue tentacles coiled tightly around sailors' waists, and even when severed, they writhed across the deck, gnawing at the terrified crew.\\n\\n\"The crewmate's limbs thrashed in the air, crying out my name. That was the most terrifying sight of my seafaring career.\" The captain's voice trembled between his lips and teeth. He was not lying.\\n\\nThe colossal sea siren surfaced, its gnarled tentacles coiling tightly around the ship. Its back loomed like a drifting island. The first mate drove a searing iron spear into its gaping maw, lined with a thousand razor-sharp teeth. A spray of foul black blood splattered across the deck, darkening the planks. The crew narrowly escaped a fatal attack, but as the captain turned back, he saw the stern tower crushed beneath a massive tentacle, shattered as easily as Nikador's Lance of Fury cracking open a walnut shell. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Charge forward or retreat? All eyes turned to the captainâ€”\\n\\n\"Hard to port! Rowers, full speed! Unfurl all sails, prepare the ram for impact!\"\\n\\nThe captain's cloak billowed in the roaring wind, and the crew steeled themselves, ready to face death. Steel clashed against scales, the keel shattered, and the sea siren let out a wailing cry. Its once-mighty form, now drained of its former power, slowly sank into the depths of the sea."

        "Aidonia's Deceased Gravestones",
        "Aidonia â€” the snow-dusted kingdom of death â€” once stood tall amidst the blizzards, and now remains silent beneath them.\\n\\nAlmost all humankind enjoyed the pleasures of eternal life in the spring-filled lands in the endless Era Chrysea, yet a few souls grew weary of the countless cycles of day and night and decided to seek the end of life. \"Why does life exist? And where should it go?\" Eleusis, the leader of the Ascetics, advanced north with his followers as he muttered this eternal question, seeking a sweet and frozen long dream. The robed ascetics settled in the desolate northern wasteland, building a solemn city-state where snow fell relentlessly all year round â€” A place later known as \"Aidonia.\"\\n\\nHow the Era Chrysea ended had long been lost to the annals of history, but the \"First of the Dead\" in Amphoreus was said to have come from Aidonia. That person received the gift of death from {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} â€” both a merciful blessing and the highest of honors.\\n\\nThe people of Aidonia were long accustomed to the harsh and lethal cold. The snow itself, long steeped in the silent faith of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}, also greedily absorbed the warmth of life as it soon touched the earth. Long ago, travelers entering Aidonia's demesne would often find anonymous frozen bodies lying dead by the roadside, unfortunates who had returned to the embrace of the {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Hand of Shadow{RUBY_E#}. The north wind howled, and the dead became markers on the road, guiding and warning those who journeyed through the snow. Travelers always hurried through Aidonia while the breath of life remained within them.\\n\\nIn time, the Aidonians came upon gravestones of mourning standing tall in the barren land, realizing that someone was offering their blessings to the cycle of death and the passing of life.\\n\\nBeneath the gravestone slumbers an unknown girl. A zone of death surrounds her like a shadowy shroud, and even the Skeletarasses that inhaled the breath of death withered away around her form. The Aidonians sensed the merciful touch of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} on her and welcomed her back to the city as their Holy Maiden. The faithful followers of the Death Titan, in reverence, emulated her, erecting towering gravestones in the wastelands to mark the end of long journeys and life's return to death â€” For life and death are both journeys, and this land only maintains boundary stones that recorded the paths taken.\\n\\nThe gravestones were warning distant travelers that no one stayed there and no one rested there... The dead, too, are travelers. They are the north wind, the falling snow, and the countless threads that connect them."

        "Once, an aggressive fool questioned the believers in Aidonia, unbelieving as to how there could be a religion in Amphoreus that reveres death. \"If you love {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} so much, why not just pierce your own chest with a spear?\"\\n\\nThe Aidonians regarded the man with disdain, saying, \"The River of Souls never ferries souls that are barren.\"\\n\\nSince its founding, Aidonia has been a holy site that valued life the most out of all Amphoreus. The followers of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} believe that the River of Souls' waters are cold enough to chill the bones â€” only those who have walked the earth long enough and have endured countless hardships can cross its icy abyss and face {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}. To seek the blessing of Death is not to disregard life.\\n\\nFor this reason, though the Aidonians considered death as a homecoming and gave birth to many fearsome warriors, they have never sought to conquer the fertile lands to the south â€” For those lands do not forge strong souls, and the Aidonians disdain the softness of comfort.\\n\\nAsceticism is a unique cultural hallmark of the Aidonians. Every year, when the snow subsides and the rare days of clear skies appear, they celebrate the Bone Collection Festival. Priests of Aidonia leave the city in search of animal bones buried in the wastelands and swamps. The most sacred offerings come from the remains of prehistoric beasts, long dead since many Light Calendar years ago. When their bones are struck, a deep echo seems to carry the faint whisper of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}. The animal bones, cold as if soaked in the freezing ice of the River of Souls, are transported back to the city one by one. The slightly broken ones get processed and become ornaments, to be worn by the people day and night. The best-preserved bones, on the other hand, are carefully polished by the priests into ceremonial bone swords for burials, offered as gifts during the festival.\\n\\nOne year, during the Bone Collection Festival, the Aidonians encountered that girl in the wasteland. Soon, rumors spread that \"her touch could allow one to cross the barrier of the River of Souls and directly face death.\"\\n\\nDevotees of Death flocked to the temple to meet the emissary of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}. The Aidonian priests, sensing that the girl threatened their faith, consecrated her as the Maiden of War, forbidding commoners from approaching her. Only those ascetics who had endured the trials of the world and revered both life and death were allowed to be embraced by her, and through her hand return their souls to the afterlife. The girl donned the long robes prepared by the priests, executed her ritual with her bare hands, and buried humankind with her embrace.\\n\\nThe Aidonians genuinely believe that \"The River of Souls never ferries souls that are barren.\" Yet, the River of Souls does not question the weight of the soul. It simply flows, leading all life to its inevitable end, where all souls converge."

At the journey's end, he met the Bough of Rift and completed his philosophical methods to experience the world before the great tree. Under the giant tree, Thalesus established a courtyard and named it the Grove of Epiphany, a place for people to awaken their spirits, seek wisdom, and grasp the way.\\n\\nThe thoughts of {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#} became so enhanced that they became written scrolls or quietly turned into the whispering flora of the grove... The noise of the Grove was born from there. From these debates and intellectual exchanges, new schools of thought emerged.\\n\\nAlthough differentiated from one another, the schools were interwoven â€” much like the overlaying branches of the giant tree... Through centuries of argument and scholarly heritage, the First Scholar's insights have evolved into the Seven Sages and seven primary schools of thought, as well as many different viewpoints.\\n\\n\"All knowledge of the world should become the leaves of the Grove, to shield the sun and help the giant tree flourish.\" Every city-state seeking wisdom from the Grove must offer equal knowledge in return. Thus, countless ideas are nourished, and countless new leaves sprout.\\n\\nFor centuries, should any scrolls containing knowledge be found on trade caravans passing through the Grove's narrow passage or ships arriving at the port, they would become a part of the Grove's library regardless of the scroll's nationality or language. The scholars, or rather, \"bandits,\" transformed the Grove into Amphoreus' best school by ways of spending incomprehensible amounts of wealth on knowledge, hiring copywriters to steal knowledge, or even outright robbery of knowledge. The scholars of the Grove used questions as sacrificial vassals and thoughts as reverence, and bowed their heads at the supreme reason in this world.\\n\\nBeginning with the planting of life, returning to the spirit of the wood, the Dewy Heartwood collects all knowledge that flows to it from the world. {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#} listened to the growing noise of the Grove, and never spoke."

        "Each thought of the Grove of Epiphany is like a branch on the giant tree. The veins form hundreds of viewpoints, expanding like an intricate web of young boughs. Though independent, they intertwine, ultimately forming the thriving canopy of the great tree.\\n\\nOne branch pointed its leaf stalk toward itself, twisting in intricate coils. The Ascetics of Lotophagism were captivated by the very patterns of the tree's leaves and flowers, believing that all life and even the cosmos were visible, tangible realities. Their practice was not merely asceticism for its own sake, but a method of harmonizing all things â€” seeing asceticism not as the denial of self, but as a direct path to understanding it.\\n\\nAnother branch bore heavy fruit, filling the boughs. Scholars of Caprism specialized in the study, breeding, and preservation of animals. The many forms of the chimeras, both pitiful and beautiful, were their small but meaningful experiment to understanding the vast diversity of life.\\n\\nOne branch twisted into a perfect proportion, precise and elegant. The scholars of Nodism asserted that \"all things are numbers,\" believing everything could be mapped mathematically. As one of the earliest schools to form in the Grove, they imposed strict standards, proclaiming \"No scholar who is ignorant of geometry may enter\" and regarded mathematics as the very means by which {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#} governs the world.\\n\\nAnother branch grew thick and resilient, sturdy and enduring. Helkolithism required the scholars to prove their discipline by swinging a sling before admission, casting stones beyond a specific range. This was a test to demonstrate their commitment to \"perfectionism\" in thought, physical rigor, and competitive spirit.\\n\\nOne branch alternated between drooping and standing tall, transmitting an exquisite beauty to the senses. The Erythrokeramists view art and sensibility as the core of logical thinking, believing that the rawest and most refined knowledge comes from direct sensory experience, leading to a more enlightened and profound understanding of the world.\\n\\nHigh above, in the lush treetop, one branch devoted and worshipful stood closest to the heart of the giant tree. This branch was the most suited for ritual. The Venerationists excelled in the understanding of Titan ceremonies and the deployment of divine miracles, earning the nickname \"The Cradle of Amphoreus' Politicians.\" They not only governed the Grove's sacred rites but also influenced the very fabric of Amphoreus' politics. However, there was a new and sharp young shoot, rising in opposition...\\n\\nThe Nousporist inherited the First Scholar's teachings on the soul, and specialized in the transformation and ascension of life and matter. It was the youngest school, yet with the most cutting-edge arguments, focused on tracing the origins of all life and material existence.\\n\\nThe Seven Sages of the Seven Schools each presided over their respective fields of study, with no hierarchy among them. The towering giant tree of reason, the symbolic head of the Seven Sages, spread knowledge and reason like branches, scattering them across the world amid endless debates and intellectual discourse."

So... what must we prepare?\" The chief stroked his white beard with a jolly smile.\\n\"The Brew Festival!\" The fairies cheered in unison.\\n\\nAt the beginning, the Membrance Maze was but a barren land. A small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae brought seeds from the outside world and taught the fairies to plant them. When the seeds bloomed into flowers, the fairies followed their lead, collecting nectar along the grape trellises, where golden fuzzy-legged bees buzzed about. Then came the fruits, ripe and plump â€” the season of harvest. The fairies would gather to sing celebratory songs and hold feasts lasting deep into the night. And after the night? They'd bottle up that year's nectar, bury it deep in the earth, and wait for it to ferment into a potion that'd heal both winter's cold and the aches of growing up.\\n\\nThat's how every Brew Festival goes.\\nBut this year, the chief asked as he tugged his white beard, \"Has anyone seen Relimem?\"\\n\\nThe fairies searched high and low â€” until they found Relimem fast asleep at the treehouse door. A bubble puffed from the corner of its mouth, clearly immersed in an exceptionally wonderful dream. The curious Milimem crept closer and heard it murmuring in its sleep â€” \"Snowy, Reney... you promised to return. Together, we'll drink the Quillorb Fruit Brew we buried last year!\"\\n\\nIn the dream, Relimem had turned into a giant â€” so humongous, it completely blocked the tree hole to Membrance Maze. The two tiny children couldn't find a way in. Snowy and Reney tried tickling Relimem's ears with bulrush, bouncing on its belly, calling its name over and over. But Relimem slept on, far too deeply to hear them.\\n\"Oh no... what if Snowy and Reney never came back because I blocked the way?\"\\nRelimem's heart began to pound in its dream.\\n\\n\"A... Achoo!\"\\nWith a loud sneeze, Relimem woke up. Phew! Good thing it hadn't turned into a giant treehole-blocking Relimem after all. But... there were fairies gathered all around.\\n\"Snowy and Reney... did they come?\"\\nThe fairies shook their heads. No one could remember how many Brew Festivals it had been since the last time they showed up.\\nRelimem drooped again. Maybe it should've stayed in that dream just a little longer.\\nLittle Relimem didn't quite know how to describe this emotion.

        "\"Don't forget our promise! Whenever you blow your Wishing Whistle, no matter how far away you are, we'll hear you.\"\\n\\nThat was the first time the small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae had stumbled into the Membrance Maze and met the fairies. They'd been playing hide-and-seek in the yard with their friends when they accidentally fell into a tree hole hidden in the tall weeds. It was deep â€” so, so deep â€” like a bottomless slide. But instead of crashing in a daze at the bottom, they tumbled right into a crowd of fairies...\\n\"One two three four five six seven! So many puppies â€” wait, no, rabbits?\"\\n\"No no no! We're do re mi fa sol la ti! I'm Dolimem, that's Solimem, and that one's Relimem!\"\\n\\nTheir friendship with the fairies was like a thousand shooting stars â€” sudden, sparkling, and unforgettable. They spent a day full of laughter together. But soon, it was time to go. If they didn't head back, Mom and Dad would start to worry.\\n\"Will we get to see each other again?\" the boy asked, a little sad.\\nFarewell... See you again... The fairies didn't quite understand those words. In the Membrance Maze, no one ever left, so there was no need to say goodbye. But judging from the look on the children's faces, they realized it must be something upsetting. The purple Relimem thought for a moment. \"Wait, Snowy, Reney! I have something for you!\"\\n\\nThe boy and girl held Relimem's gift in their palms. It was a tiny whistle shaped like a fairy's ear, handmade by Relimem itself. It had seven holes, and when blown, each note rang clear and sweet â€” Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti. Relimem said earnestly, \"If you ever want to come back and play in the Membrance Maze again, just blow this whistle. No matter if we're sleeping, singing, or building leaf houses... we'll hear you.

And a promise they could no longer keep."

        "The sea wave is an endless rondo. Weary of pleasure-seeking harbors, the sailors unfurled their charts and chose their journey's end. Their compass stilled, its trembling needle pointing toward Styxia, the city of everlasting joy along the coast â€” their fated tomb of bliss. They took no heed. Unaware of death, they raised their sails in drunken glee and stepped eagerly into Phagousa's ballroom.\\n\\nFollowing the rhythm of tides and the moon, the sailors sang as they harpooned the spines of whales, as they rammed their prows into ancient glaciers, as they sailed, ever laughing... until they were lost in the mist, until the lighthouse loomed close â€” until at last, they crashed upon the reef.\\n\\nThe wrecked ships sank beneath the waves. From the sea wave, the undying rose again. The sailor climbed ashore, seaweed and salt crusting his body. The revelers of the lighthouse had waited long. They bowed, inviting him to join the eternal celebration. Following the music, they crossed the long causeway and stepped onto the white lighthouse between the reefs. Fueled by whale oil, the flame of Styxia's beacon danced cold and blue, encased in lenses carved from crystals. The tower itself stood as a massive water lyre. With every step upward, guests could see seawater siphoning through glass pipes embedded in the masonry, pulsing with the rhythm of the sea. On the terrace, the revelers danced hand in hand, circling the light as music filled the air. Their shadows stretched long across the distant sea. And there â€” at the edge of the horizon â€” the sailor saw it: the city of eternal joy he had dreamed of.\\n\\nThat was an age before decay, when pain, sorrow, and death were still unborn. Styxia basked in Phagousa's favor, embraced by a crescent bay like a cradle, lulled by lullabies tender as sleep.\\n\\nThe sailor's lips trembled with anxiety. Before him, the revelers opened their arms â€” welcoming him as kin, to share in boundless ecstasy. Yet, behind him stretched the endless gray sea. Wreckage littered the reefs, drowned souls drifting in the waves, sea anemones and coral creeping across their skin. He remembered the moment he fell â€” how the undercurrents dragged him into the dark and hopeless deep. The sea siren's cold hand had caressed his cheek. Through her blurred, gentle singing, he awoke and was pushed back toward the shimmering surface.\\n\\nYet that one moment of hesitation â€” just one glance back â€” was enough. The gates to bliss shut. Smiling, the revelers turned the sailor away from entering Styxia â€” for a soul still shaking off the remnants of trance could never withstand true rapture."

        "Like those who came before him, the lonely sailor lingers between sea and city, poised on the threshold between the mortal world and revelry. He wipes the oil seeping from the wound of a stranded whale. At nightfall, he lights the beacon. Then, seated before the light, he begins to play melodies yet unplayed on the water lyre.\\n\\nThe lighthouse hums with each note, and all of Styxia is swept into song. The melodies, sometimes gentle, sometimes fevered, stir boundless fantasies of delight in the Styxia Queen's heart. When the sailor begins to play in reverse from the final semibreve rest, the tune becomes whimsical and sprightly. Then, white longboats carry tumblers and jesters and glide through the canals. Men and women in splendid attire line the shores, their faces covered in masks decorated with gold leaf and feathers. The Queen slips among them, drifting through the scent of lilac and almonds.\\n\\nThen, the sailor sharpens the rhythm, the notes ringing wild and triumphant. A city-wide play unfolds with Styxia as the stage. Townsfolk dressed as pirates wave black flags, storming the walls that were never defended. They plunder wine and gold, hang nobles upon flower-strewn gallows, and crown every beggar in the city. At the finale, the tower is set ablaze, and the crowd dances madly to the lyre's music, drunk beyond reason.\\n\\nThe crashing tide dampens the sheet music, blurring notes that are soothing and slow. In the mist before the lighthouse, the Queen steps into a new script. Dressed in a sea-blue fishtail dress, she plays the attendant of Phagousa â€” the Queen of the sea sirens.\\n\\nIn this tale, the sirens are tasked to guard an anguish beyond mortal imagination in the ocean's deepest. Using their flesh and blood, they guide the pitch-dark calamity into the Chalice of Plenty, exchanging for Styxia's eternal joy. When the appointed time comes, the sirens will finally follow the lighthouse's light and the lyre's song, and walk along the causeway to enter Styxia. The people of the city will take their hands, and together, they shall join the never-ending celebration.\\n\\nThe Queen of Styxia wades into the water, embracing an imagined demise. On a night when the tides break free from the moon's restraints, the hollow tears of the sea sirens rise like foam deep beneath the waves. They hope. They wait. They gaze upon moonlight they've never known â€” then their flesh dissolves. A pity that there is no moonlight tonight. Only the lighthouse flickers, as always â€” The tears ascend instead of the sea sirens, surfacing onto the glimmering sea surface, like floating foam that dissolves into the waves.\\n\\nThe lonely sailor is granted his wish. The revelers, eyes glistening with blissful tears, welcome him into Styxia. By the time the first note of the song rings out, the withered wings of death have already covered this city of everlasting joy."

        "Aidonia â€” the snow-dusted kingdom of death â€” once stood tall amidst the blizzards, and now remains silent beneath them.\\n\\nAlmost all humankind enjoyed the pleasures of eternal life in the spring-filled lands in the endless Era Chrysea, yet a few souls grew weary of the countless cycles of day and night and decided to seek the end of life. \"Why does life exist? And where should it go?\" Eleusis, the leader of the Ascetics, advanced north with his followers as he muttered this eternal question, seeking a sweet and frozen long dream. The robed ascetics settled in the desolate northern wasteland, building a solemn city-state where snow fell relentlessly all year round â€” A place later known as \"Aidonia.\"\\n\\nHow the Era Chrysea ended had long been lost to the annals of history, but the \"First of the Dead\" in Amphoreus was said to have come from Aidonia. That person received the gift of death from {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} â€” both a merciful blessing and the highest of honors.\\n\\nThe people of Aidonia were long accustomed to the harsh and lethal cold. The snow itself, long steeped in the silent faith of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}, also greedily absorbed the warmth of life as it soon touched the earth. Long ago, travelers entering Aidonia's demesne would often find anonymous frozen bodies lying dead by the roadside, unfortunates who had returned to the embrace of the {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Hand of Shadow{RUBY_E#}. The north wind howled, and the dead became markers on the road, guiding and warning those who journeyed through the snow. Travelers always hurried through Aidonia while the breath of life remained within them.\\n\\nIn time, the Aidonians came upon gravestones of mourning standing tall in the barren land, realizing that someone was offering their blessings to the cycle of death and the passing of life.\\n\\nBeneath the gravestone slumbers an unknown girl. A zone of death surrounds her like a shadowy shroud, and even the Skeletarasses that inhaled the breath of death withered away around her form. The Aidonians sensed the merciful touch of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} on her and welcomed her back to the city as their Holy Maiden. The faithful followers of the Death Titan, in reverence, emulated her, erecting towering gravestones in the wastelands to mark the end of long journeys and life's return to death â€” For life and death are both journeys, and this land only maintains boundary stones that recorded the paths taken.\\n\\nThe gravestones were warning distant travelers that no one stayed there and no one rested there... The dead, too, are travelers. They are the north wind, the falling snow, and the countless threads that connect them."

        "Once, an aggressive fool questioned the believers in Aidonia, unbelieving as to how there could be a religion in Amphoreus that reveres death. \"If you love {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} so much, why not just pierce your own chest with a spear?\"\\n\\nThe Aidonians regarded the man with disdain, saying, \"The River of Souls never ferries souls that are barren.\"\\n\\nSince its founding, Aidonia has been a holy site that valued life the most out of all Amphoreus. The followers of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} believe that the River of Souls' waters are cold enough to chill the bones â€” only those who have walked the earth long enough and have endured countless hardships can cross its icy abyss and face {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}. To seek the blessing of Death is not to disregard life.\\n\\nFor this reason, though the Aidonians considered death as a homecoming and gave birth to many fearsome warriors, they have never sought to conquer the fertile lands to the south â€” For those lands do not forge strong souls, and the Aidonians disdain the softness of comfort.\\n\\nAsceticism is a unique cultural hallmark of the Aidonians. Every year, when the snow subsides and the rare days of clear skies appear, they celebrate the Bone Collection Festival. Priests of Aidonia leave the city in search of animal bones buried in the wastelands and swamps. The most sacred offerings come from the remains of prehistoric beasts, long dead since many Light Calendar years ago. When their bones are struck, a deep echo seems to carry the faint whisper of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}. The animal bones, cold as if soaked in the freezing ice of the River of Souls, are transported back to the city one by one. The slightly broken ones get processed and become ornaments, to be worn by the people day and night. The best-preserved bones, on the other hand, are carefully polished by the priests into ceremonial bone swords for burials, offered as gifts during the festival.\\n\\nOne year, during the Bone Collection Festival, the Aidonians encountered that girl in the wasteland. Soon, rumors spread that \"her touch could allow one to cross the barrier of the River of Souls and directly face death.\"\\n\\nDevotees of Death flocked to the temple to meet the emissary of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}. The Aidonian priests, sensing that the girl threatened their faith, consecrated her as the Maiden of War, forbidding commoners from approaching her. Only those ascetics who had endured the trials of the world and revered both life and death were allowed to be embraced by her, and through her hand return their souls to the afterlife. The girl donned the long robes prepared by the priests, executed her ritual with her bare hands, and buried humankind with her embrace.\\n\\nThe Aidonians genuinely believe that \"The River of Souls never ferries souls that are barren.\" Yet, the River of Souls does not question the weight of the soul. It simply flows, leading all life to its inevitable end, where all souls converge."

At the journey's end, he met the Bough of Rift and completed his philosophical methods to experience the world before the great tree. Under the giant tree, Thalesus established a courtyard and named it the Grove of Epiphany, a place for people to awaken their spirits, seek wisdom, and grasp the way.\\n\\nThe thoughts of {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#} became so enhanced that they became written scrolls or quietly turned into the whispering flora of the grove... The noise of the Grove was born from there. From these debates and intellectual exchanges, new schools of thought emerged.\\n\\nAlthough differentiated from one another, the schools were interwoven â€” much like the overlaying branches of the giant tree... Through centuries of argument and scholarly heritage, the First Scholar's insights have evolved into the Seven Sages and seven primary schools of thought, as well as many different viewpoints.\\n\\n\"All knowledge of the world should become the leaves of the Grove, to shield the sun and help the giant tree flourish.\" Every city-state seeking wisdom from the Grove must offer equal knowledge in return. Thus, countless ideas are nourished, and countless new leaves sprout.\\n\\nFor centuries, should any scrolls containing knowledge be found on trade caravans passing through the Grove's narrow passage or ships arriving at the port, they would become a part of the Grove's library regardless of the scroll's nationality or language. The scholars, or rather, \"bandits,\" transformed the Grove into Amphoreus' best school by ways of spending incomprehensible amounts of wealth on knowledge, hiring copywriters to steal knowledge, or even outright robbery of knowledge. The scholars of the Grove used questions as sacrificial vassals and thoughts as reverence, and bowed their heads at the supreme reason in this world.\\n\\nBeginning with the planting of life, returning to the spirit of the wood, the Dewy Heartwood collects all knowledge that flows to it from the world. {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#} listened to the growing noise of the Grove, and never spoke."

        "Each thought of the Grove of Epiphany is like a branch on the giant tree. The veins form hundreds of viewpoints, expanding like an intricate web of young boughs. Though independent, they intertwine, ultimately forming the thriving canopy of the great tree.\\n\\nOne branch pointed its leaf stalk toward itself, twisting in intricate coils. The Ascetics of Lotophagism were captivated by the very patterns of the tree's leaves and flowers, believing that all life and even the cosmos were visible, tangible realities. Their practice was not merely asceticism for its own sake, but a method of harmonizing all things â€” seeing asceticism not as the denial of self, but as a direct path to understanding it.\\n\\nAnother branch bore heavy fruit, filling the boughs. Scholars of Caprism specialized in the study, breeding, and preservation of animals. The many forms of the chimeras, both pitiful and beautiful, were their small but meaningful experiment to understanding the vast diversity of life.\\n\\nOne branch twisted into a perfect proportion, precise and elegant. The scholars of Nodism asserted that \"all things are numbers,\" believing everything could be mapped mathematically. As one of the earliest schools to form in the Grove, they imposed strict standards, proclaiming \"No scholar who is ignorant of geometry may enter\" and regarded mathematics as the very means by which {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#} governs the world.\\n\\nAnother branch grew thick and resilient, sturdy and enduring. Helkolithism required the scholars to prove their discipline by swinging a sling before admission, casting stones beyond a specific range. This was a test to demonstrate their commitment to \"perfectionism\" in thought, physical rigor, and competitive spirit.\\n\\nOne branch alternated between drooping and standing tall, transmitting an exquisite beauty to the senses. The Erythrokeramists view art and sensibility as the core of logical thinking, believing that the rawest and most refined knowledge comes from direct sensory experience, leading to a more enlightened and profound understanding of the world.\\n\\nHigh above, in the lush treetop, one branch devoted and worshipful stood closest to the heart of the giant tree. This branch was the most suited for ritual. The Venerationists excelled in the understanding of Titan ceremonies and the deployment of divine miracles, earning the nickname \"The Cradle of Amphoreus' Politicians.\" They not only governed the Grove's sacred rites but also influenced the very fabric of Amphoreus' politics. However, there was a new and sharp young shoot, rising in opposition...\\n\\nThe Nousporist inherited the First Scholar's teachings on the soul, and specialized in the transformation and ascension of life and matter. It was the youngest school, yet with the most cutting-edge arguments, focused on tracing the origins of all life and material existence.\\n\\nThe Seven Sages of the Seven Schools each presided over their respective fields of study, with no hierarchy among them. The towering giant tree of reason, the symbolic head of the Seven Sages, spread knowledge and reason like branches, scattering them across the world amid endless debates and intellectual discourse."

So... what must we prepare?\" The chief stroked his white beard with a jolly smile.\\n\"The Brew Festival!\" The fairies cheered in unison.\\n\\nAt the beginning, the Membrance Maze was but a barren land. A small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae brought seeds from the outside world and taught the fairies to plant them. When the seeds bloomed into flowers, the fairies followed their lead, collecting nectar along the grape trellises, where golden fuzzy-legged bees buzzed about. Then came the fruits, ripe and plump â€” the season of harvest. The fairies would gather to sing celebratory songs and hold feasts lasting deep into the night. And after the night? They'd bottle up that year's nectar, bury it deep in the earth, and wait for it to ferment into a potion that'd heal both winter's cold and the aches of growing up.\\n\\nThat's how every Brew Festival goes.\\nBut this year, the chief asked as he tugged his white beard, \"Has anyone seen Relimem?\"\\n\\nThe fairies searched high and low â€” until they found Relimem fast asleep at the treehouse door. A bubble puffed from the corner of its mouth, clearly immersed in an exceptionally wonderful dream. The curious Milimem crept closer and heard it murmuring in its sleep â€” \"Snowy, Reney... you promised to return. Together, we'll drink the Quillorb Fruit Brew we buried last year!\"\\n\\nIn the dream, Relimem had turned into a giant â€” so humongous, it completely blocked the tree hole to Membrance Maze. The two tiny children couldn't find a way in. Snowy and Reney tried tickling Relimem's ears with bulrush, bouncing on its belly, calling its name over and over. But Relimem slept on, far too deeply to hear them.\\n\"Oh no... what if Snowy and Reney never came back because I blocked the way?\"\\nRelimem's heart began to pound in its dream.\\n\\n\"A... Achoo!\"\\nWith a loud sneeze, Relimem woke up. Phew! Good thing it hadn't turned into a giant treehole-blocking Relimem after all. But... there were fairies gathered all around.\\n\"Snowy and Reney... did they come?\"\\nThe fairies shook their heads. No one could remember how many Brew Festivals it had been since the last time they showed up.\\nRelimem drooped again. Maybe it should've stayed in that dream just a little longer.\\nLittle Relimem didn't quite know how to describe this emotion. But if it had to try â€” it felt just like the last day of summer, when you let those flickering fireflies in the glass jar flutter away."

Whenever you blow your Wishing Whistle, no matter how far away you are, we'll hear you.\"\\n\\nThat was the first time the small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae had stumbled into the Membrance Maze and met the fairies. They'd been playing hide-and-seek in the yard with their friends when they accidentally fell into a tree hole hidden in the tall weeds. It was deep â€” so, so deep â€” like a bottomless slide. But instead of crashing in a daze at the bottom, they tumbled right into a crowd of fairies...\\n\"One two three four five six seven! So many puppies â€” wait, no, rabbits?\"\\n\"No no no! We're do re mi fa sol la ti! I'm Dolimem, that's Solimem, and that one's Relimem!\"\\n\\nTheir friendship with the fairies was like a thousand shooting stars â€” sudden, sparkling, and unforgettable. They spent a day full of laughter together. But soon, it was time to go. If they didn't head back, Mom and Dad would start to worry.\\n\"Will we get to see each other again?\" the boy asked, a little sad.\\nFarewell... See you again... The fairies didn't quite understand those words. In the Membrance Maze, no one ever left, so there was no need to say goodbye. But judging from the look on the children's faces, they realized it must be something upsetting. The purple Relimem thought for a moment. \"Wait, Snowy, Reney! I have something for you!\"\\n\\nThe boy and girl held Relimem's gift in their palms. It was a tiny whistle shaped like a fairy's ear, handmade by Relimem itself. It had seven holes, and when blown, each note rang clear and sweet â€” Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti. Relimem said earnestly, \"If you ever want to come back and play in the Membrance Maze again, just blow this whistle. No matter if we're sleeping, singing, or building leaf houses... we'll hear you. And we'll open the tree hole to the maze for you.\"\\n\\n\"A mystery flute that wakes up fairies!\" the girl giggled. \"Pinky promise â€” we'll come back again.\"\\nFrom then on, Relimem's happiest moments were when the whistle sounded. It would always shout with joy â€” \"I hear it! I hear it with both ears!\"\\n\\nAs time passed, Snowy and Reney, who had left Aedes Elysiae behind, remembered everything about their childhood: The rusted tin toys, the armless toy soldiers in the barn, the crocheted felt flowers, the rains that never came, the dried-up blood, the wheat fields burned down to brittle husks...\\nBut they forgot the little whistle buried in the dirt... And a promise they could no longer keep."

Unaware of death, they raised their sails in drunken glee and stepped eagerly into Phagousa's ballroom.\\n\\nFollowing the rhythm of tides and the moon, the sailors sang as they harpooned the spines of whales, as they rammed their prows into ancient glaciers, as they sailed, ever laughing... until they were lost in the mist, until the lighthouse loomed close â€” until at last, they crashed upon the reef.\\n\\nThe wrecked ships sank beneath the waves.

Fueled by whale oil, the flame of Styxia's beacon danced cold and blue, encased in lenses carved from crystals. The tower itself stood as a massive water lyre. With every step upward, guests could see seawater siphoning through glass pipes embedded in the masonry, pulsing with the rhythm of the sea.

And there â€” at the edge of the horizon â€” the sailor saw it: the city of eternal joy he had dreamed of.\\n\\nThat was an age before decay, when pain, sorrow, and death were still unborn. Styxia basked in Phagousa's favor, embraced by a crescent bay like a cradle, lulled by lullabies tender as sleep.\\n\\nThe sailor's lips trembled with anxiety. Before him, the revelers opened their arms â€” welcoming him as kin, to share in boundless ecstasy. Yet, behind him stretched the endless gray sea. Wreckage littered the reefs, drowned souls drifting in the waves, sea anemones and coral creeping across their skin. He remembered the moment he fell â€” how the undercurrents dragged him into the dark and hopeless deep. The sea siren's cold hand had caressed his cheek. Through her blurred, gentle singing, he awoke and was pushed back toward the shimmering surface.\\n\\nYet that one moment of hesitation â€” just one glance back â€” was enough. The gates to bliss shut. Smiling, the revelers turned the sailor away from entering Styxia â€” for a soul still shaking off the remnants of trance could never withstand true rapture."

        "Like those who came before him, the lonely sailor lingers between sea and city, poised on the threshold between the mortal world and revelry. He wipes the oil seeping from the wound of a stranded whale. At nightfall, he lights the beacon. Then, seated before the light, he begins to play melodies yet unplayed on the water lyre.\\n\\nThe lighthouse hums with each note, and all of Styxia is swept into song. The melodies, sometimes gentle, sometimes fevered, stir boundless fantasies of delight in the Styxia Queen's heart. When the sailor begins to play in reverse from the final semibreve rest, the tune becomes whimsical and sprightly. Then, white longboats carry tumblers and jesters and glide through the canals. Men and women in splendid attire line the shores, their faces covered in masks decorated with gold leaf and feathers. The Queen slips among them, drifting through the scent of lilac and almonds.\\n\\nThen, the sailor sharpens the rhythm, the notes ringing wild and triumphant. A city-wide play unfolds with Styxia as the stage. Townsfolk dressed as pirates wave black flags, storming the walls that were never defended. They plunder wine and gold, hang nobles upon flower-strewn gallows, and crown every beggar in the city. At the finale, the tower is set ablaze, and the crowd dances madly to the lyre's music, drunk beyond reason.\\n\\nThe crashing tide dampens the sheet music, blurring notes that are soothing and slow. In the mist before the lighthouse, the Queen steps into a new script. Dressed in a sea-blue fishtail dress, she plays the attendant of Phagousa â€” the Queen of the sea sirens.\\n\\nIn this tale, the sirens are tasked to guard an anguish beyond mortal imagination in the ocean's deepest. Using their flesh and blood, they guide the pitch-dark calamity into the Chalice of Plenty, exchanging for Styxia's eternal joy. When the appointed time comes, the sirens will finally follow the lighthouse's light and the lyre's song, and walk along the causeway to enter Styxia. The people of the city will take their hands, and together, they shall join the never-ending celebration.\\n\\nThe Queen of Styxia wades into the water, embracing an imagined demise. On a night when the tides break free from the moon's restraints, the hollow tears of the sea sirens rise like foam deep beneath the waves. They hope. They wait. They gaze upon moonlight they've never known â€” then their flesh dissolves. A pity that there is no moonlight tonight. Only the lighthouse flickers, as always â€” The tears ascend instead of the sea sirens, surfacing onto the glimmering sea surface, like floating foam that dissolves into the waves.\\n\\nThe lonely sailor is granted his wish. The revelers, eyes glistening with blissful tears, welcome him into Styxia. By the time the first note of the song rings out, the withered wings of death have already covered this city of everlasting joy."

        "Aidonia â€” the snow-dusted kingdom of death â€” once stood tall amidst the blizzards, and now remains silent beneath them.\\n\\nAlmost all humankind enjoyed the pleasures of eternal life in the spring-filled lands in the endless Era Chrysea, yet a few souls grew weary of the countless cycles of day and night and decided to seek the end of life. \"Why does life exist? And where should it go?\" Eleusis, the leader of the Ascetics, advanced north with his followers as he muttered this eternal question, seeking a sweet and frozen long dream. The robed ascetics settled in the desolate northern wasteland, building a solemn city-state where snow fell relentlessly all year round â€” A place later known as \"Aidonia.\"\\n\\nHow the Era Chrysea ended had long been lost to the annals of history, but the \"First of the Dead\" in Amphoreus was said to have come from Aidonia. That person received the gift of death from {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} â€” both a merciful blessing and the highest of honors.\\n\\nThe people of Aidonia were long accustomed to the harsh and lethal cold. The snow itself, long steeped in the silent faith of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}, also greedily absorbed the warmth of life as it soon touched the earth. Long ago, travelers entering Aidonia's demesne would often find anonymous frozen bodies lying dead by the roadside, unfortunates who had returned to the embrace of the {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Hand of Shadow{RUBY_E#}. The north wind howled, and the dead became markers on the road, guiding and warning those who journeyed through the snow. Travelers always hurried through Aidonia while the breath of life remained within them.\\n\\nIn time, the Aidonians came upon gravestones of mourning standing tall in the barren land, realizing that someone was offering their blessings to the cycle of death and the passing of life.\\n\\nBeneath the gravestone slumbers an unknown girl. A zone of death surrounds her like a shadowy shroud, and even the Skeletarasses that inhaled the breath of death withered away around her form. The Aidonians sensed the merciful touch of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} on her and welcomed her back to the city as their Holy Maiden. The faithful followers of the Death Titan, in reverence, emulated her, erecting towering gravestones in the wastelands to mark the end of long journeys and life's return to death â€” For life and death are both journeys, and this land only maintains boundary stones that recorded the paths taken.\\n\\nThe gravestones were warning distant travelers that no one stayed there and no one rested there... The dead, too, are travelers. They are the north wind, the falling snow, and the countless threads that connect them."

        "Once, an aggressive fool questioned the believers in Aidonia, unbelieving as to how there could be a religion in Amphoreus that reveres death. \"If you love {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} so much, why not just pierce your own chest with a spear?\"\\n\\nThe Aidonians regarded the man with disdain, saying, \"The River of Souls never ferries souls that are barren.\"\\n\\nSince its founding, Aidonia has been a holy site that valued life the most out of all Amphoreus. The followers of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} believe that the River of Souls' waters are cold enough to chill the bones â€” only those who have walked the earth long enough and have endured countless hardships can cross its icy abyss and face {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}. To seek the blessing of Death is not to disregard life.\\n\\nFor this reason, though the Aidonians considered death as a homecoming and gave birth to many fearsome warriors, they have never sought to conquer the fertile lands to the south â€” For those lands do not forge strong souls, and the Aidonians disdain the softness of comfort.\\n\\nAsceticism is a unique cultural hallmark of the Aidonians. Every year, when the snow subsides and the rare days of clear skies appear, they celebrate the Bone Collection Festival. Priests of Aidonia leave the city in search of animal bones buried in the wastelands and swamps. The most sacred offerings come from the remains of prehistoric beasts, long dead since many Light Calendar years ago. When their bones are struck, a deep echo seems to carry the faint whisper of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}. The animal bones, cold as if soaked in the freezing ice of the River of Souls, are transported back to the city one by one. The slightly broken ones get processed and become ornaments, to be worn by the people day and night. The best-preserved bones, on the other hand, are carefully polished by the priests into ceremonial bone swords for burials, offered as gifts during the festival.\\n\\nOne year, during the Bone Collection Festival, the Aidonians encountered that girl in the wasteland. Soon, rumors spread that \"her touch could allow one to cross the barrier of the River of Souls and directly face death.\"\\n\\nDevotees of Death flocked to the temple to meet the emissary of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}. The Aidonian priests, sensing that the girl threatened their faith, consecrated her as the Maiden of War, forbidding commoners from approaching her. Only those ascetics who had endured the trials of the world and revered both life and death were allowed to be embraced by her, and through her hand return their souls to the afterlife. The girl donned the long robes prepared by the priests, executed her ritual with her bare hands, and buried humankind with her embrace.\\n\\nThe Aidonians genuinely believe that \"The River of Souls never ferries souls that are barren.\" Yet, the River of Souls does not question the weight of the soul. It simply flows, leading all life to its inevitable end, where all souls converge."

        "Thalesus, the First Scholar, embarked on his journey around Amphoreus from his coastal home city, Mileutus, at his age of majority, seeking spiritual meaning within the Mnestia faith.\\n\\nAlong the way, his strange experiences and new visions reshaped his thoughts on nature and the origin of the world. At the journey's end, he met the Bough of Rift and completed his philosophical methods to experience the world before the great tree. Under the giant tree, Thalesus established a courtyard and named it the Grove of Epiphany, a place for people to awaken their spirits, seek wisdom, and grasp the way.\\n\\nThe thoughts of {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#} became so enhanced that they became written scrolls or quietly turned into the whispering flora of the grove... The noise of the Grove was born from there. From these debates and intellectual exchanges, new schools of thought emerged.\\n\\nAlthough differentiated from one another, the schools were interwoven â€” much like the overlaying branches of the giant tree... Through centuries of argument and scholarly heritage, the First Scholar's insights have evolved into the Seven Sages and seven primary schools of thought, as well as many different viewpoints.\\n\\n\"All knowledge of the world should become the leaves of the Grove, to shield the sun and help the giant tree flourish.\" Every city-state seeking wisdom from the Grove must offer equal knowledge in return. Thus, countless ideas are nourished, and countless new leaves sprout.\\n\\nFor centuries, should any scrolls containing knowledge be found on trade caravans passing through the Grove's narrow passage or ships arriving at the port, they would become a part of the Grove's library regardless of the scroll's nationality or language. The scholars, or rather, \"bandits,\" transformed the Grove into Amphoreus' best school by ways of spending incomprehensible amounts of wealth on knowledge, hiring copywriters to steal knowledge, or even outright robbery of knowledge. The scholars of the Grove used questions as sacrificial vassals and thoughts as reverence, and bowed their heads at the supreme reason in this world.\\n\\nBeginning with the planting of life, returning to the spirit of the wood, the Dewy Heartwood collects all knowledge that flows to it from the world. {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#} listened to the growing noise of the Grove, and never spoke."

        "Each thought of the Grove of Epiphany is like a branch on the giant tree. The veins form hundreds of viewpoints, expanding like an intricate web of young boughs. Though independent, they intertwine, ultimately forming the thriving canopy of the great tree.\\n\\nOne branch pointed its leaf stalk toward itself, twisting in intricate coils. The Ascetics of Lotophagism were captivated by the very patterns of the tree's leaves and flowers, believing that all life and even the cosmos were visible, tangible realities. Their practice was not merely asceticism for its own sake, but a method of harmonizing all things â€” seeing asceticism not as the denial of self, but as a direct path to understanding it.\\n\\nAnother branch bore heavy fruit, filling the boughs. Scholars of Caprism specialized in the study, breeding, and preservation of animals. The many forms of the chimeras, both pitiful and beautiful, were their small but meaningful experiment to understanding the vast diversity of life.\\n\\nOne branch twisted into a perfect proportion, precise and elegant. The scholars of Nodism asserted that \"all things are numbers,\" believing everything could be mapped mathematically. As one of the earliest schools to form in the Grove, they imposed strict standards, proclaiming \"No scholar who is ignorant of geometry may enter\" and regarded mathematics as the very means by which {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#} governs the world.\\n\\nAnother branch grew thick and resilient, sturdy and enduring. Helkolithism required the scholars to prove their discipline by swinging a sling before admission, casting stones beyond a specific range. This was a test to demonstrate their commitment to \"perfectionism\" in thought, physical rigor, and competitive spirit.\\n\\nOne branch alternated between drooping and standing tall, transmitting an exquisite beauty to the senses. The Erythrokeramists view art and sensibility as the core of logical thinking, believing that the rawest and most refined knowledge comes from direct sensory experience, leading to a more enlightened and profound understanding of the world.\\n\\nHigh above, in the lush treetop, one branch devoted and worshipful stood closest to the heart of the giant tree. This branch was the most suited for ritual. The Venerationists excelled in the understanding of Titan ceremonies and the deployment of divine miracles, earning the nickname \"The Cradle of Amphoreus' Politicians.\" They not only governed the Grove's sacred rites but also influenced the very fabric of Amphoreus' politics. However, there was a new and sharp young shoot, rising in opposition...\\n\\nThe Nousporist inherited the First Scholar's teachings on the soul, and specialized in the transformation and ascension of life and matter. It was the youngest school, yet with the most cutting-edge arguments, focused on tracing the origins of all life and material existence.\\n\\nThe Seven Sages of the Seven Schools each presided over their respective fields of study, with no hierarchy among them. The towering giant tree of reason, the symbolic head of the Seven Sages, spread knowledge and reason like branches, scattering them across the world amid endless debates and intellectual discourse."

So... what must we prepare?\" The chief stroked his white beard with a jolly smile.\\n\"The Brew Festival!\" The fairies cheered in unison.\\n\\nAt the beginning, the Membrance Maze was but a barren land. A small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae brought seeds from the outside world and taught the fairies to plant them. When the seeds bloomed into flowers, the fairies followed their lead, collecting nectar along the grape trellises, where golden fuzzy-legged bees buzzed about. Then came the fruits, ripe and plump â€” the season of harvest. The fairies would gather to sing celebratory songs and hold feasts lasting deep into the night. And after the night? They'd bottle up that year's nectar, bury it deep in the earth, and wait for it to ferment into a potion that'd heal both winter's cold and the aches of growing up.\\n\\nThat's how every Brew Festival goes.\\nBut this year, the chief asked as he tugged his white beard, \"Has anyone seen Relimem?\"\\n\\nThe fairies searched high and low â€” until they found Relimem fast asleep at the treehouse door. A bubble puffed from the corner of its mouth, clearly immersed in an exceptionally wonderful dream. The curious Milimem crept closer and heard it murmuring in its sleep â€” \"Snowy, Reney... you promised to return. Together, we'll drink the Quillorb Fruit Brew we buried last year!\"\\n\\nIn the dream, Relimem had turned into a giant â€” so humongous, it completely blocked the tree hole to Membrance Maze. The two tiny children couldn't find a way in. Snowy and Reney tried tickling Relimem's ears with bulrush, bouncing on its belly, calling its name over and over. But Relimem slept on, far too deeply to hear them.\\n\"Oh no... what if Snowy and Reney never came back because I blocked the way?\"\\nRelimem's heart began to pound in its dream.\\n\\n\"A... Achoo!\"\\nWith a loud sneeze, Relimem woke up. Phew! Good thing it hadn't turned into a giant treehole-blocking Relimem after all. But... there were fairies gathered all around.\\n\"Snowy and Reney... did they come?\"\\nThe fairies shook their heads. No one could remember how many Brew Festivals it had been since the last time they showed up.\\nRelimem drooped again. Maybe it should've stayed in that dream just a little longer.\\nLittle Relimem didn't quite know how to describe this emotion. But if it had to try â€” it felt just like the last day of summer, when you let those flickering fireflies in the glass jar flutter away."

        "\"Don't forget our promise! Whenever you blow your Wishing Whistle, no matter how far away you are, we'll hear you.\"\\n\\nThat was the first time the small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae had stumbled into the Membrance Maze and met the fairies. They'd been playing hide-and-seek in the yard with their friends when they accidentally fell into a tree hole hidden in the tall weeds. It was deep â€” so, so deep â€” like a bottomless slide. But instead of crashing in a daze at the bottom, they tumbled right into a crowd of fairies...\\n\"One two three four five six seven! So many puppies â€” wait, no, rabbits?\"\\n\"No no no! We're do re mi fa sol la ti! I'm Dolimem, that's Solimem, and that one's Relimem!\"\\n\\nTheir friendship with the fairies was like a thousand shooting stars â€” sudden, sparkling, and unforgettable. They spent a day full of laughter together. But soon, it was time to go. If they didn't head back, Mom and Dad would start to worry.\\n\"Will we get to see each other again?\" the boy asked, a little sad.\\nFarewell... See you again... The fairies didn't quite understand those words. In the Membrance Maze, no one ever left, so there was no need to say goodbye. But judging from the look on the children's faces, they realized it must be something upsetting. The purple Relimem thought for a moment. \"Wait, Snowy, Reney! I have something for you!\"\\n\\nThe boy and girl held Relimem's gift in their palms. It was a tiny whistle shaped like a fairy's ear, handmade by Relimem itself. It had seven holes, and when blown, each note rang clear and sweet â€” Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti. Relimem said earnestly, \"If you ever want to come back and play in the Membrance Maze again, just blow this whistle. No matter if we're sleeping, singing, or building leaf houses... we'll hear you. And we'll open the tree hole to the maze for you.\"\\n\\n\"A mystery flute that wakes up fairies!\" the girl giggled. \"Pinky promise â€” we'll come back again.\"\\nFrom then on, Relimem's happiest moments were when the whistle sounded. It would always shout with joy â€” \"I hear it! I hear it with both ears!\"\\n\\nAs time passed, Snowy and Reney, who had left Aedes Elysiae behind, remembered everything about their childhood: The rusted tin toys, the armless toy soldiers in the barn, the crocheted felt flowers, the rains that never came, the dried-up blood, the wheat fields burned down to brittle husks...\\nBut they forgot the little whistle buried in the dirt... And a promise they could no longer keep."

Their compass stilled, its trembling needle pointing toward Styxia, the city of everlasting joy along the coast â€” their fated tomb of bliss. They took no heed. Unaware of death, they raised their sails in drunken glee and stepped eagerly into Phagousa's ballroom.\\n\\nFollowing the rhythm of tides and the moon, the sailors sang as they harpooned the spines of whales, as they rammed their prows into ancient glaciers, as they sailed, ever laughing... until they were lost in the mist, until the lighthouse loomed close â€” until at last, they crashed upon the reef.\\n\\nThe wrecked ships sank beneath the waves.

They bowed, inviting him to join the eternal celebration. Following the music, they crossed the long causeway and stepped onto the white lighthouse between the reefs. Fueled by whale oil, the flame of Styxia's beacon danced cold and blue, encased in lenses carved from crystals. The tower itself stood as a massive water lyre. With every step upward, guests could see seawater siphoning through glass pipes embedded in the masonry, pulsing with the rhythm of the sea. On the terrace, the revelers danced hand in hand, circling the light as music filled the air. Their shadows stretched long across the distant sea. And there â€” at the edge of the horizon â€” the sailor saw it: the city of eternal joy he had dreamed of.\\n\\nThat was an age before decay, when pain, sorrow, and death were still unborn. Styxia basked in Phagousa's favor, embraced by a crescent bay like a cradle, lulled by lullabies tender as sleep.\\n\\nThe sailor's lips trembled with anxiety. Before him, the revelers opened their arms â€” welcoming him as kin, to share in boundless ecstasy. Yet, behind him stretched the endless gray sea. Wreckage littered the reefs, drowned souls drifting in the waves, sea anemones and coral creeping across their skin. He remembered the moment he fell â€” how the undercurrents dragged him into the dark and hopeless deep. The sea siren's cold hand had caressed his cheek. Through her blurred, gentle singing, he awoke and was pushed back toward the shimmering surface.\\n\\nYet that one moment of hesitation â€” just one glance back â€” was enough. The gates to bliss shut. Smiling, the revelers turned the sailor away from entering Styxia â€” for a soul still shaking off the remnants of trance could never withstand true rapture."

He wipes the oil seeping from the wound of a stranded whale. At nightfall, he lights the beacon. Then, seated before the light, he begins to play melodies yet unplayed on the water lyre.\\n\\nThe lighthouse hums with each note, and all of Styxia is swept into song. The melodies, sometimes gentle, sometimes fevered, stir boundless fantasies of delight in the Styxia Queen's heart. When the sailor begins to play in reverse from the final semibreve rest, the tune becomes whimsical and sprightly. Then, white longboats carry tumblers and jesters and glide through the canals. Men and women in splendid attire line the shores, their faces covered in masks decorated with gold leaf and feathers. The Queen slips among them, drifting through the scent of lilac and almonds.\\n\\nThen, the sailor sharpens the rhythm, the notes ringing wild and triumphant.

They plunder wine and gold, hang nobles upon flower-strewn gallows, and crown every beggar in the city. At the finale, the tower is set ablaze, and the crowd dances madly to the lyre's music, drunk beyond reason.\\n\\nThe crashing tide dampens the sheet music, blurring notes that are soothing and slow. In the mist before the lighthouse, the Queen steps into a new script. Dressed in a sea-blue fishtail dress, she plays the attendant of Phagousa â€” the Queen of the sea sirens.\\n\\nIn this tale, the sirens are tasked to guard an anguish beyond mortal imagination in the ocean's deepest. Using their flesh and blood, they guide the pitch-dark calamity into the Chalice of Plenty, exchanging for Styxia's eternal joy. When the appointed time comes, the sirens will finally follow the lighthouse's light and the lyre's song, and walk along the causeway to enter Styxia. The people of the city will take their hands, and together, they shall join the never-ending celebration.\\n\\nThe Queen of Styxia wades into the water, embracing an imagined demise. On a night when the tides break free from the moon's restraints, the hollow tears of the sea sirens rise like foam deep beneath the waves. They hope. They wait. They gaze upon moonlight they've never known â€” then their flesh dissolves. A pity that there is no moonlight tonight. Only the lighthouse flickers, as always â€” The tears ascend instead of the sea sirens, surfacing onto the glimmering sea surface, like floating foam that dissolves into the waves.\\n\\nThe lonely sailor is granted his wish. The revelers, eyes glistening with blissful tears, welcome him into Styxia. By the time the first note of the song rings out, the withered wings of death have already covered this city of everlasting joy."

        "Aidonia â€” the snow-dusted kingdom of death â€” once stood tall amidst the blizzards, and now remains silent beneath them.\\n\\nAlmost all humankind enjoyed the pleasures of eternal life in the spring-filled lands in the endless Era Chrysea, yet a few souls grew weary of the countless cycles of day and night and decided to seek the end of life. \"Why does life exist? And where should it go?\" Eleusis, the leader of the Ascetics, advanced north with his followers as he muttered this eternal question, seeking a sweet and frozen long dream. The robed ascetics settled in the desolate northern wasteland, building a solemn city-state where snow fell relentlessly all year round â€” A place later known as \"Aidonia.\"\\n\\nHow the Era Chrysea ended had long been lost to the annals of history, but the \"First of the Dead\" in Amphoreus was said to have come from Aidonia. That person received the gift of death from {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} â€” both a merciful blessing and the highest of honors.\\n\\nThe people of Aidonia were long accustomed to the harsh and lethal cold. The snow itself, long steeped in the silent faith of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}, also greedily absorbed the warmth of life as it soon touched the earth. Long ago, travelers entering Aidonia's demesne would often find anonymous frozen bodies lying dead by the roadside, unfortunates who had returned to the embrace of the {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Hand of Shadow{RUBY_E#}. The north wind howled, and the dead became markers on the road, guiding and warning those who journeyed through the snow. Travelers always hurried through Aidonia while the breath of life remained within them.\\n\\nIn time, the Aidonians came upon gravestones of mourning standing tall in the barren land, realizing that someone was offering their blessings to the cycle of death and the passing of life.\\n\\nBeneath the gravestone slumbers an unknown girl. A zone of death surrounds her like a shadowy shroud, and even the Skeletarasses that inhaled the breath of death withered away around her form. The Aidonians sensed the merciful touch of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} on her and welcomed her back to the city as their Holy Maiden. The faithful followers of the Death Titan, in reverence, emulated her, erecting towering gravestones in the wastelands to mark the end of long journeys and life's return to death â€” For life and death are both journeys, and this land only maintains boundary stones that recorded the paths taken.\\n\\nThe gravestones were warning distant travelers that no one stayed there and no one rested there... The dead, too, are travelers. They are the north wind, the falling snow, and the countless threads that connect them."

        "Aidonia's Deathward Bone Chains",
        "Once, an aggressive fool questioned the believers in Aidonia, unbelieving as to how there could be a religion in Amphoreus that reveres death. \"If you love {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} so much, why not just pierce your own chest with a spear?\"\\n\\nThe Aidonians regarded the man with disdain, saying, \"The River of Souls never ferries souls that are barren.\"\\n\\nSince its founding, Aidonia has been a holy site that valued life the most out of all Amphoreus. The followers of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} believe that the River of Souls' waters are cold enough to chill the bones â€” only those who have walked the earth long enough and have endured countless hardships can cross its icy abyss and face {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}. To seek the blessing of Death is not to disregard life.\\n\\nFor this reason, though the Aidonians considered death as a homecoming and gave birth to many fearsome warriors, they have never sought to conquer the fertile lands to the south â€” For those lands do not forge strong souls, and the Aidonians disdain the softness of comfort.\\n\\nAsceticism is a unique cultural hallmark of the Aidonians. Every year, when the snow subsides and the rare days of clear skies appear, they celebrate the Bone Collection Festival. Priests of Aidonia leave the city in search of animal bones buried in the wastelands and swamps. The most sacred offerings come from the remains of prehistoric beasts, long dead since many Light Calendar years ago. When their bones are struck, a deep echo seems to carry the faint whisper of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}. The animal bones, cold as if soaked in the freezing ice of the River of Souls, are transported back to the city one by one. The slightly broken ones get processed and become ornaments, to be worn by the people day and night. The best-preserved bones, on the other hand, are carefully polished by the priests into ceremonial bone swords for burials, offered as gifts during the festival.\\n\\nOne year, during the Bone Collection Festival, the Aidonians encountered that girl in the wasteland. Soon, rumors spread that \"her touch could allow one to cross the barrier of the River of Souls and directly face death.\"\\n\\nDevotees of Death flocked to the temple to meet the emissary of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}. The Aidonian priests, sensing that the girl threatened their faith, consecrated her as the Maiden of War, forbidding commoners from approaching her. Only those ascetics who had endured the trials of the world and revered both life and death were allowed to be embraced by her, and through her hand return their souls to the afterlife. The girl donned the long robes prepared by the priests, executed her ritual with her bare hands, and buried humankind with her embrace.\\n\\nThe Aidonians genuinely believe that \"The River of Souls never ferries souls that are barren.\" Yet, the River of Souls does not question the weight of the soul. It simply flows, leading all life to its inevitable end, where all souls converge."

        "Thalesus, the First Scholar, embarked on his journey around Amphoreus from his coastal home city, Mileutus, at his age of majority, seeking spiritual meaning within the Mnestia faith.\\n\\nAlong the way, his strange experiences and new visions reshaped his thoughts on nature and the origin of the world. At the journey's end, he met the Bough of Rift and completed his philosophical methods to experience the world before the great tree. Under the giant tree, Thalesus established a courtyard and named it the Grove of Epiphany, a place for people to awaken their spirits, seek wisdom, and grasp the way.\\n\\nThe thoughts of {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#} became so enhanced that they became written scrolls or quietly turned into the whispering flora of the grove... The noise of the Grove was born from there. From these debates and intellectual exchanges, new schools of thought emerged.\\n\\nAlthough differentiated from one another, the schools were interwoven â€” much like the overlaying branches of the giant tree... Through centuries of argument and scholarly heritage, the First Scholar's insights have evolved into the Seven Sages and seven primary schools of thought, as well as many different viewpoints.\\n\\n\"All knowledge of the world should become the leaves of the Grove, to shield the sun and help the giant tree flourish.\" Every city-state seeking wisdom from the Grove must offer equal knowledge in return. Thus, countless ideas are nourished, and countless new leaves sprout.\\n\\nFor centuries, should any scrolls containing knowledge be found on trade caravans passing through the Grove's narrow passage or ships arriving at the port, they would become a part of the Grove's library regardless of the scroll's nationality or language. The scholars, or rather, \"bandits,\" transformed the Grove into Amphoreus' best school by ways of spending incomprehensible amounts of wealth on knowledge, hiring copywriters to steal knowledge, or even outright robbery of knowledge. The scholars of the Grove used questions as sacrificial vassals and thoughts as reverence, and bowed their heads at the supreme reason in this world.\\n\\nBeginning with the planting of life, returning to the spirit of the wood, the Dewy Heartwood collects all knowledge that flows to it from the world. {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#} listened to the growing noise of the Grove, and never spoke."

        "Each thought of the Grove of Epiphany is like a branch on the giant tree. The veins form hundreds of viewpoints, expanding like an intricate web of young boughs. Though independent, they intertwine, ultimately forming the thriving canopy of the great tree.\\n\\nOne branch pointed its leaf stalk toward itself, twisting in intricate coils. The Ascetics of Lotophagism were captivated by the very patterns of the tree's leaves and flowers, believing that all life and even the cosmos were visible, tangible realities. Their practice was not merely asceticism for its own sake, but a method of harmonizing all things â€” seeing asceticism not as the denial of self, but as a direct path to understanding it.\\n\\nAnother branch bore heavy fruit, filling the boughs. Scholars of Caprism specialized in the study, breeding, and preservation of animals. The many forms of the chimeras, both pitiful and beautiful, were their small but meaningful experiment to understanding the vast diversity of life.\\n\\nOne branch twisted into a perfect proportion, precise and elegant. The scholars of Nodism asserted that \"all things are numbers,\" believing everything could be mapped mathematically. As one of the earliest schools to form in the Grove, they imposed strict standards, proclaiming \"No scholar who is ignorant of geometry may enter\" and regarded mathematics as the very means by which {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#} governs the world.\\n\\nAnother branch grew thick and resilient, sturdy and enduring. Helkolithism required the scholars to prove their discipline by swinging a sling before admission, casting stones beyond a specific range. This was a test to demonstrate their commitment to \"perfectionism\" in thought, physical rigor, and competitive spirit.\\n\\nOne branch alternated between drooping and standing tall, transmitting an exquisite beauty to the senses. The Erythrokeramists view art and sensibility as the core of logical thinking, believing that the rawest and most refined knowledge comes from direct sensory experience, leading to a more enlightened and profound understanding of the world.\\n\\nHigh above, in the lush treetop, one branch devoted and worshipful stood closest to the heart of the giant tree. This branch was the most suited for ritual. The Venerationists excelled in the understanding of Titan ceremonies and the deployment of divine miracles, earning the nickname \"The Cradle of Amphoreus' Politicians.\" They not only governed the Grove's sacred rites but also influenced the very fabric of Amphoreus' politics. However, there was a new and sharp young shoot, rising in opposition...\\n\\nThe Nousporist inherited the First Scholar's teachings on the soul, and specialized in the transformation and ascension of life and matter. It was the youngest school, yet with the most cutting-edge arguments, focused on tracing the origins of all life and material existence.\\n\\nThe Seven Sages of the Seven Schools each presided over their respective fields of study, with no hierarchy among them. The towering giant tree of reason, the symbolic head of the Seven Sages, spread knowledge and reason like branches, scattering them across the world amid endless debates and intellectual discourse."

So... what must we prepare?\" The chief stroked his white beard with a jolly smile.\\n\"The Brew Festival!\" The fairies cheered in unison.\\n\\nAt the beginning, the Membrance Maze was but a barren land. A small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae brought seeds from the outside world and taught the fairies to plant them. When the seeds bloomed into flowers, the fairies followed their lead, collecting nectar along the grape trellises, where golden fuzzy-legged bees buzzed about. Then came the fruits, ripe and plump â€” the season of harvest. The fairies would gather to sing celebratory songs and hold feasts lasting deep into the night. And after the night? They'd bottle up that year's nectar, bury it deep in the earth, and wait for it to ferment into a potion that'd heal both winter's cold and the aches of growing up.\\n\\nThat's how every Brew Festival goes.\\nBut this year, the chief asked as he tugged his white beard, \"Has anyone seen Relimem?\"\\n\\nThe fairies searched high and low â€” until they found Relimem fast asleep at the treehouse door. A bubble puffed from the corner of its mouth, clearly immersed in an exceptionally wonderful dream. The curious Milimem crept closer and heard it murmuring in its sleep â€” \"Snowy, Reney... you promised to return. Together, we'll drink the Quillorb Fruit Brew we buried last year!\"\\n\\nIn the dream, Relimem had turned into a giant â€” so humongous, it completely blocked the tree hole to Membrance Maze. The two tiny children couldn't find a way in. Snowy and Reney tried tickling Relimem's ears with bulrush, bouncing on its belly, calling its name over and over. But Relimem slept on, far too deeply to hear them.\\n\"Oh no... what if Snowy and Reney never came back because I blocked the way?\"\\nRelimem's heart began to pound in its dream.\\n\\n\"A... Achoo!\"\\nWith a loud sneeze, Relimem woke up. Phew! Good thing it hadn't turned into a giant treehole-blocking Relimem after all. But... there were fairies gathered all around.\\n\"Snowy and Reney... did they come?\"\\nThe fairies shook their heads. No one could remember how many Brew Festivals it had been since the last time they showed up.\\nRelimem drooped again. Maybe it should've stayed in that dream just a little longer.\\nLittle Relimem didn't quite know how to describe this emotion. But if it had to try â€” it felt just like the last day of summer, when you let those flickering fireflies in the glass jar flutter away."

        "\"Don't forget our promise! Whenever you blow your Wishing Whistle, no matter how far away you are, we'll hear you.\"\\n\\nThat was the first time the small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae had stumbled into the Membrance Maze and met the fairies. They'd been playing hide-and-seek in the yard with their friends when they accidentally fell into a tree hole hidden in the tall weeds. It was deep â€” so, so deep â€” like a bottomless slide. But instead of crashing in a daze at the bottom, they tumbled right into a crowd of fairies...\\n\"One two three four five six seven! So many puppies â€” wait, no, rabbits?\"\\n\"No no no! We're do re mi fa sol la ti! I'm Dolimem, that's Solimem, and that one's Relimem!\"\\n\\nTheir friendship with the fairies was like a thousand shooting stars â€” sudden, sparkling, and unforgettable. They spent a day full of laughter together. But soon, it was time to go. If they didn't head back, Mom and Dad would start to worry.\\n\"Will we get to see each other again?\" the boy asked, a little sad.\\nFarewell... See you again... The fairies didn't quite understand those words. In the Membrance Maze, no one ever left, so there was no need to say goodbye. But judging from the look on the children's faces, they realized it must be something upsetting. The purple Relimem thought for a moment. \"Wait, Snowy, Reney! I have something for you!\"\\n\\nThe boy and girl held Relimem's gift in their palms. It was a tiny whistle shaped like a fairy's ear, handmade by Relimem itself. It had seven holes, and when blown, each note rang clear and sweet â€” Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti. Relimem said earnestly, \"If you ever want to come back and play in the Membrance Maze again, just blow this whistle. No matter if we're sleeping, singing, or building leaf houses... we'll hear you. And we'll open the tree hole to the maze for you.\"\\n\\n\"A mystery flute that wakes up fairies!\" the girl giggled. \"Pinky promise â€” we'll come back again.\"\\nFrom then on, Relimem's happiest moments were when the whistle sounded. It would always shout with joy â€” \"I hear it! I hear it with both ears!\"\\n\\nAs time passed, Snowy and Reney, who had left Aedes Elysiae behind, remembered everything about their childhood: The rusted tin toys, the armless toy soldiers in the barn, the crocheted felt flowers, the rains that never came, the dried-up blood, the wheat fields burned down to brittle husks...\\nBut they forgot the little whistle buried in the dirt... And a promise they could no longer keep."

Their compass stilled, its trembling needle pointing toward Styxia, the city of everlasting joy along the coast â€” their fated tomb of bliss. They took no heed. Unaware of death, they raised their sails in drunken glee and stepped eagerly into Phagousa's ballroom.\\n\\nFollowing the rhythm of tides and the moon, the sailors sang as they harpooned the spines of whales, as they rammed their prows into ancient glaciers, as they sailed, ever laughing... until they were lost in the mist, until the lighthouse loomed close â€” until at last, they crashed upon the reef.\\n\\nThe wrecked ships sank beneath the waves. From the sea wave, the undying rose again. The sailor climbed ashore, seaweed and salt crusting his body. The revelers of the lighthouse had waited long. They bowed, inviting him to join the eternal celebration. Following the music, they crossed the long causeway and stepped onto the white lighthouse between the reefs. Fueled by whale oil, the flame of Styxia's beacon danced cold and blue, encased in lenses carved from crystals. The tower itself stood as a massive water lyre. With every step upward, guests could see seawater siphoning through glass pipes embedded in the masonry, pulsing with the rhythm of the sea. On the terrace, the revelers danced hand in hand, circling the light as music filled the air. Their shadows stretched long across the distant sea. And there â€” at the edge of the horizon â€” the sailor saw it: the city of eternal joy he had dreamed of.\\n\\nThat was an age before decay, when pain, sorrow, and death were still unborn. Styxia basked in Phagousa's favor, embraced by a crescent bay like a cradle, lulled by lullabies tender as sleep.\\n\\nThe sailor's lips trembled with anxiety. Before him, the revelers opened their arms â€” welcoming him as kin, to share in boundless ecstasy. Yet, behind him stretched the endless gray sea. Wreckage littered the reefs, drowned souls drifting in the waves, sea anemones and coral creeping across their skin. He remembered the moment he fell â€” how the undercurrents dragged him into the dark and hopeless deep. The sea siren's cold hand had caressed his cheek. Through her blurred, gentle singing, he awoke and was pushed back toward the shimmering surface.\\n\\nYet that one moment of hesitation â€” just one glance back â€” was enough. The gates to bliss shut. Smiling, the revelers turned the sailor away from entering Styxia â€” for a soul still shaking off the remnants of trance could never withstand true rapture."

        "Like those who came before him, the lonely sailor lingers between sea and city, poised on the threshold between the mortal world and revelry. He wipes the oil seeping from the wound of a stranded whale. At nightfall, he lights the beacon. Then, seated before the light, he begins to play melodies yet unplayed on the water lyre.\\n\\nThe lighthouse hums with each note, and all of Styxia is swept into song. The melodies, sometimes gentle, sometimes fevered, stir boundless fantasies of delight in the Styxia Queen's heart. When the sailor begins to play in reverse from the final semibreve rest, the tune becomes whimsical and sprightly. Then, white longboats carry tumblers and jesters and glide through the canals. Men and women in splendid attire line the shores, their faces covered in masks decorated with gold leaf and feathers. The Queen slips among them, drifting through the scent of lilac and almonds.\\n\\nThen, the sailor sharpens the rhythm, the notes ringing wild and triumphant. A city-wide play unfolds with Styxia as the stage. Townsfolk dressed as pirates wave black flags, storming the walls that were never defended. They plunder wine and gold, hang nobles upon flower-strewn gallows, and crown every beggar in the city. At the finale, the tower is set ablaze, and the crowd dances madly to the lyre's music, drunk beyond reason.\\n\\nThe crashing tide dampens the sheet music, blurring notes that are soothing and slow. In the mist before the lighthouse, the Queen steps into a new script. Dressed in a sea-blue fishtail dress, she plays the attendant of Phagousa â€” the Queen of the sea sirens.\\n\\nIn this tale, the sirens are tasked to guard an anguish beyond mortal imagination in the ocean's deepest. Using their flesh and blood, they guide the pitch-dark calamity into the Chalice of Plenty, exchanging for Styxia's eternal joy. When the appointed time comes, the sirens will finally follow the lighthouse's light and the lyre's song, and walk along the causeway to enter Styxia. The people of the city will take their hands, and together, they shall join the never-ending celebration.\\n\\nThe Queen of Styxia wades into the water, embracing an imagined demise. On a night when the tides break free from the moon's restraints, the hollow tears of the sea sirens rise like foam deep beneath the waves. They hope. They wait. They gaze upon moonlight they've never known â€” then their flesh dissolves. A pity that there is no moonlight tonight. Only the lighthouse flickers, as always â€” The tears ascend instead of the sea sirens, surfacing onto the glimmering sea surface, like floating foam that dissolves into the waves.\\n\\nThe lonely sailor is granted his wish. The revelers, eyes glistening with blissful tears, welcome him into Styxia. By the time the first note of the song rings out, the withered wings of death have already covered this city of everlasting joy."
