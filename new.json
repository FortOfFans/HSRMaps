During the transformation, increases ATK by ****4[i]%**** and Max HP by ****5[i]%****. After using an attack, restores HP equal to **7[i]%** of his Max HP. When Khaslana takes a killing blow, he will not get **knocked down**. Instead, he will restore HP equal to **2[i]%** of Max HP and immediately launch a final hit. For every 1 remaining **Khaslana's extra turn**, the final hit's DMG multiplier decreases by **3[f1]%** of its original multiplier value.\nWhen the transformation ends, increases all allies' SPD by **6[i]%** for 1 turn.",

The crew narrowly escaped a fatal attack, but as the captain turned back, he saw the stern tower crushed beneath a massive tentacle, shattered as easily as Nikador's Lance of Fury cracking open a walnut shell. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Charge forward or retreat? All eyes turned to the captainâ€”\\n\\n\"Hard to port! Rowers, full speed!

So... what must we prepare?\" The chief stroked his white beard with a jolly smile.\\n\"The Brew Festival!\" The fairies cheered in unison.\\n\\nAt the beginning, the Membrance Maze was but a barren land. A small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae brought seeds from the outside world and taught the fairies to plant them. When the seeds bloomed into flowers, the fairies followed their lead, collecting nectar along the grape trellises, where golden fuzzy-legged bees buzzed about. Then came the fruits, ripe and plump â€” the season of harvest. The fairies would gather to sing celebratory songs and hold feasts lasting deep into the night. And after the night? They'd bottle up that year's nectar, bury it deep in the earth, and wait for it to ferment into a potion that'd heal both winter's cold and the aches of growing up.\\n\\nThat's how every Brew Festival goes.\\nBut this year, the chief asked as he tugged his white beard, \"Has anyone seen Relimem?\"\\n\\nThe fairies searched high and low â€” until they found Relimem fast asleep at the treehouse door. A bubble puffed from the corner of its mouth, clearly immersed in an exceptionally wonderful dream. The curious Milimem crept closer and heard it murmuring in its sleep â€” \"Snowy, Reney... you promised to return. Together, we'll drink the Quillorb Fruit Brew we buried last year!\"\\n\\nIn the dream, Relimem had turned into a giant â€” so humongous, it completely blocked the tree hole to Membrance Maze. The two tiny children couldn't find a way in. Snowy and Reney tried tickling Relimem's ears with bulrush, bouncing on its belly, calling its name over and over. But Relimem slept on, far too deeply to hear them.\\n\"Oh no... what if Snowy and Reney never came back because I blocked the way?\"\\nRelimem's heart began to pound in its dream.\\n\\n\"A... Achoo!\"\\nWith a loud sneeze, Relimem woke up. Phew! Good thing it hadn't turned into a giant treehole-blocking Relimem after all. But... there were fairies gathered all around.\\n\"Snowy and Reney... did they come?\"\\nThe fairies shook their heads. No one could remember how many Brew Festivals it had been since the last time they showed up.\\nRelimem drooped again. Maybe it should've stayed in that dream just a little longer.\\nLittle Relimem didn't quite know how to describe this emotion. But if it had to try â€” it felt just like the last day of summer, when you let those flickering fireflies in the glass jar flutter away."

Whenever you blow your Wishing Whistle, no matter how far away you are, we'll hear you.\"\\n\\nThat was the first time the small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae had stumbled into the Membrance Maze and met the fairies. They'd been playing hide-and-seek in the yard with their friends when they accidentally fell into a tree hole hidden in the tall weeds. It was deep â€” so, so deep â€” like a bottomless slide. But instead of crashing in a daze at the bottom, they tumbled right into a crowd of fairies...\\n\"One two three four five six seven! So many puppies â€” wait, no, rabbits?\"\\n\"No no no! We're do re mi fa sol la ti! I'm Dolimem, that's Solimem, and that one's Relimem!\"\\n\\nTheir friendship with the fairies was like a thousand shooting stars â€” sudden, sparkling, and unforgettable. They spent a day full of laughter together. But soon, it was time to go. If they didn't head back, Mom and Dad would start to worry.\\n\"Will we get to see each other again?\" the boy asked, a little sad.\\nFarewell... See you again... The fairies didn't quite understand those words. In the Membrance Maze, no one ever left, so there was no need to say goodbye. But judging from the look on the children's faces, they realized it must be something upsetting. The purple Relimem thought for a moment. \"Wait, Snowy, Reney! I have something for you!\"\\n\\nThe boy and girl held Relimem's gift in their palms. It was a tiny whistle shaped like a fairy's ear, handmade by Relimem itself. It had seven holes, and when blown, each note rang clear and sweet â€” Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti. Relimem said earnestly, \"If you ever want to come back and play in the Membrance Maze again, just blow this whistle. No matter if we're sleeping, singing, or building leaf houses... we'll hear you. And we'll open the tree hole to the maze for you.\"\\n\\n\"A mystery flute that wakes up fairies!\" the girl giggled. \"Pinky promise â€” we'll come back again.\"\\nFrom then on, Relimem's happiest moments were when the whistle sounded. It would always shout with joy â€” \"I hear it! I hear it with both ears!\"\\n\\nAs time passed, Snowy and Reney, who had left Aedes Elysiae behind, remembered everything about their childhood: The rusted tin toys, the armless toy soldiers in the barn, the crocheted felt flowers, the rains that never came, the dried-up blood, the wheat fields burned down to brittle husks...\\nBut they forgot the little whistle buried in the dirt... And a promise they could no longer keep."

Their compass stilled, its trembling needle pointing toward Styxia, the city of everlasting joy along the coast â€” their fated tomb of bliss. They took no heed. Unaware of death, they raised their sails in drunken glee and stepped eagerly into Phagousa's ballroom.\\n\\nFollowing the rhythm of tides and the moon, the sailors sang as they harpooned the spines of whales, as they rammed their prows into ancient glaciers, as they sailed, ever laughing... until they were lost in the mist, until the lighthouse loomed close â€” until at last, they crashed upon the reef.\\n\\nThe wrecked ships sank beneath the waves. From the sea wave, the undying rose again. The sailor climbed ashore, seaweed and salt crusting his body. The revelers of the lighthouse had waited long. They bowed, inviting him to join the eternal celebration. Following the music, they crossed the long causeway and stepped onto the white lighthouse between the reefs. Fueled by whale oil, the flame of Styxia's beacon danced cold and blue, encased in lenses carved from crystals. The tower itself stood as a massive water lyre. With every step upward, guests could see seawater siphoning through glass pipes embedded in the masonry, pulsing with the rhythm of the sea. On the terrace, the revelers danced hand in hand, circling the light as music filled the air. Their shadows stretched long across the distant sea. And there â€” at the edge of the horizon â€” the sailor saw it: the city of eternal joy he had dreamed of.\\n\\nThat was an age before decay, when pain, sorrow, and death were still unborn. Styxia basked in Phagousa's favor, embraced by a crescent bay like a cradle, lulled by lullabies tender as sleep.\\n\\nThe sailor's lips trembled with anxiety. Before him, the revelers opened their arms â€” welcoming him as kin, to share in boundless ecstasy. Yet, behind him stretched the endless gray sea. Wreckage littered the reefs, drowned souls drifting in the waves, sea anemones and coral creeping across their skin. He remembered the moment he fell â€” how the undercurrents dragged him into the dark and hopeless deep. The sea siren's cold hand had caressed his cheek. Through her blurred, gentle singing, he awoke and was pushed back toward the shimmering surface.\\n\\nYet that one moment of hesitation â€” just one glance back â€” was enough. The gates to bliss shut. Smiling, the revelers turned the sailor away from entering Styxia â€” for a soul still shaking off the remnants of trance could never withstand true rapture."

        "Like those who came before him, the lonely sailor lingers between sea and city, poised on the threshold between the mortal world and revelry. He wipes the oil seeping from the wound of a stranded whale. At nightfall, he lights the beacon. Then, seated before the light, he begins to play melodies yet unplayed on the water lyre.\\n\\nThe lighthouse hums with each note, and all of Styxia is swept into song. The melodies, sometimes gentle, sometimes fevered, stir boundless fantasies of delight in the Styxia Queen's heart. When the sailor begins to play in reverse from the final semibreve rest, the tune becomes whimsical and sprightly. Then, white longboats carry tumblers and jesters and glide through the canals. Men and women in splendid attire line the shores, their faces covered in masks decorated with gold leaf and feathers. The Queen slips among them, drifting through the scent of lilac and almonds.\\n\\nThen, the sailor sharpens the rhythm, the notes ringing wild and triumphant. A city-wide play unfolds with Styxia as the stage. Townsfolk dressed as pirates wave black flags, storming the walls that were never defended. They plunder wine and gold, hang nobles upon flower-strewn gallows, and crown every beggar in the city. At the finale, the tower is set ablaze, and the crowd dances madly to the lyre's music, drunk beyond reason.\\n\\nThe crashing tide dampens the sheet music, blurring notes that are soothing and slow. In the mist before the lighthouse, the Queen steps into a new script. Dressed in a sea-blue fishtail dress, she plays the attendant of Phagousa â€” the Queen of the sea sirens.\\n\\nIn this tale, the sirens are tasked to guard an anguish beyond mortal imagination in the ocean's deepest. Using their flesh and blood, they guide the pitch-dark calamity into the Chalice of Plenty, exchanging for Styxia's eternal joy. When the appointed time comes, the sirens will finally follow the lighthouse's light and the lyre's song, and walk along the causeway to enter Styxia. The people of the city will take their hands, and together, they shall join the never-ending celebration.\\n\\nThe Queen of Styxia wades into the water, embracing an imagined demise. On a night when the tides break free from the moon's restraints, the hollow tears of the sea sirens rise like foam deep beneath the waves. They hope. They wait. They gaze upon moonlight they've never known â€” then their flesh dissolves. A pity that there is no moonlight tonight. Only the lighthouse flickers, as always â€” The tears ascend instead of the sea sirens, surfacing onto the glimmering sea surface, like floating foam that dissolves into the waves.\\n\\nThe lonely sailor is granted his wish. The revelers, eyes glistening with blissful tears, welcome him into Styxia. By the time the first note of the song rings out, the withered wings of death have already covered this city of everlasting joy."

A small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae brought seeds from the outside world and taught the fairies to plant them. When the seeds bloomed into flowers, the fairies followed their lead, collecting nectar along the grape trellises, where golden fuzzy-legged bees buzzed about. Then came the fruits, ripe and plump â€” the season of harvest. The fairies would gather to sing celebratory songs and hold feasts lasting deep into the night. And after the night? They'd bottle up that year's nectar, bury it deep in the earth, and wait for it to ferment into a potion that'd heal both winter's cold and the aches of growing up.\\n\\nThat's how every Brew Festival goes.\\nBut this year, the chief asked as he tugged his white beard, \"Has anyone seen Relimem?\"\\n\\nThe fairies searched high and low â€” until they found Relimem fast asleep at the treehouse door. A bubble puffed from the corner of its mouth, clearly immersed in an exceptionally wonderful dream. The curious Milimem crept closer and heard it murmuring in its sleep â€” \"Snowy, Reney... you promised to return. Together, we'll drink the Quillorb Fruit Brew we buried last year!\"\\n\\nIn the dream, Relimem had turned into a giant â€” so humongous, it completely blocked the tree hole to Membrance Maze. The two tiny children couldn't find a way in. Snowy and Reney tried tickling Relimem's ears with bulrush, bouncing on its belly, calling its name over and over. But Relimem slept on, far too deeply to hear them.\\n\"Oh no... what if Snowy and Reney never came back because I blocked the way?\"\\nRelimem's heart began to pound in its dream.\\n\\n\"A... Achoo!\"\\nWith a loud sneeze, Relimem woke up. Phew! Good thing it hadn't turned into a giant treehole-blocking Relimem after all. But... there were fairies gathered all around.\\n\"Snowy and Reney... did they come?\"\\nThe fairies shook their heads. No one could remember how many Brew Festivals it had been since the last time they showed up.\\nRelimem drooped again. Maybe it should've stayed in that dream just a little longer.\\nLittle Relimem didn't quite know how to describe this emotion. But if it had to try â€” it felt just like the last day of summer, when you let those flickering fireflies in the glass jar flutter away."

        "Membrance Maze's Wishing Whistle",
        "\"Don't forget our promise! Whenever you blow your Wishing Whistle, no matter how far away you are, we'll hear you.\"\\n\\nThat was the first time the small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae had stumbled into the Membrance Maze and met the fairies. They'd been playing hide-and-seek in the yard with their friends when they accidentally fell into a tree hole hidden in the tall weeds. It was deep â€” so, so deep â€” like a bottomless slide. But instead of crashing in a daze at the bottom, they tumbled right into a crowd of fairies...\\n\"One two three four five six seven! So many puppies â€” wait, no, rabbits?\"\\n\"No no no! We're do re mi fa sol la ti! I'm Dolimem, that's Solimem, and that one's Relimem!\"\\n\\nTheir friendship with the fairies was like a thousand shooting stars â€” sudden, sparkling, and unforgettable. They spent a day full of laughter together. But soon, it was time to go. If they didn't head back, Mom and Dad would start to worry.\\n\"Will we get to see each other again?\" the boy asked, a little sad.\\nFarewell... See you again... The fairies didn't quite understand those words. In the Membrance Maze, no one ever left, so there was no need to say goodbye. But judging from the look on the children's faces, they realized it must be something upsetting. The purple Relimem thought for a moment. \"Wait, Snowy, Reney! I have something for you!\"\\n\\nThe boy and girl held Relimem's gift in their palms. It was a tiny whistle shaped like a fairy's ear, handmade by Relimem itself. It had seven holes, and when blown, each note rang clear and sweet â€” Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti. Relimem said earnestly, \"If you ever want to come back and play in the Membrance Maze again, just blow this whistle. No matter if we're sleeping, singing, or building leaf houses... we'll hear you. And we'll open the tree hole to the maze for you.\"\\n\\n\"A mystery flute that wakes up fairies!\" the girl giggled. \"Pinky promise â€” we'll come back again.\"\\nFrom then on, Relimem's happiest moments were when the whistle sounded. It would always shout with joy â€” \"I hear it! I hear it with both ears!\"\\n\\nAs time passed, Snowy and Reney, who had left Aedes Elysiae behind, remembered everything about their childhood: The rusted tin toys, the armless toy soldiers in the barn, the crocheted felt flowers, the rains that never came, the dried-up blood, the wheat fields burned down to brittle husks...\\nBut they forgot the little whistle buried in the dirt... And a promise they could no longer keep."

        "The sea wave is an endless rondo. Weary of pleasure-seeking harbors, the sailors unfurled their charts and chose their journey's end. Their compass stilled, its trembling needle pointing toward Styxia, the city of everlasting joy along the coast â€” their fated tomb of bliss. They took no heed. Unaware of death, they raised their sails in drunken glee and stepped eagerly into Phagousa's ballroom.\\n\\nFollowing the rhythm of tides and the moon, the sailors sang as they harpooned the spines of whales, as they rammed their prows into ancient glaciers, as they sailed, ever laughing... until they were lost in the mist, until the lighthouse loomed close â€” until at last, they crashed upon the reef.\\n\\nThe wrecked ships sank beneath the waves. From the sea wave, the undying rose again. The sailor climbed ashore, seaweed and salt crusting his body. The revelers of the lighthouse had waited long. They bowed, inviting him to join the eternal celebration. Following the music, they crossed the long causeway and stepped onto the white lighthouse between the reefs. Fueled by whale oil, the flame of Styxia's beacon danced cold and blue, encased in lenses carved from crystals. The tower itself stood as a massive water lyre. With every step upward, guests could see seawater siphoning through glass pipes embedded in the masonry, pulsing with the rhythm of the sea. On the terrace, the revelers danced hand in hand, circling the light as music filled the air. Their shadows stretched long across the distant sea. And there â€” at the edge of the horizon â€” the sailor saw it: the city of eternal joy he had dreamed of.\\n\\nThat was an age before decay, when pain, sorrow, and death were still unborn. Styxia basked in Phagousa's favor, embraced by a crescent bay like a cradle, lulled by lullabies tender as sleep.\\n\\nThe sailor's lips trembled with anxiety. Before him, the revelers opened their arms â€” welcoming him as kin, to share in boundless ecstasy. Yet, behind him stretched the endless gray sea. Wreckage littered the reefs, drowned souls drifting in the waves, sea anemones and coral creeping across their skin. He remembered the moment he fell â€” how the undercurrents dragged him into the dark and hopeless deep. The sea siren's cold hand had caressed his cheek. Through her blurred, gentle singing, he awoke and was pushed back toward the shimmering surface.\\n\\nYet that one moment of hesitation â€” just one glance back â€” was enough. The gates to bliss shut. Smiling, the revelers turned the sailor away from entering Styxia â€” for a soul still shaking off the remnants of trance could never withstand true rapture."

        "Like those who came before him, the lonely sailor lingers between sea and city, poised on the threshold between the mortal world and revelry. He wipes the oil seeping from the wound of a stranded whale. At nightfall, he lights the beacon. Then, seated before the light, he begins to play melodies yet unplayed on the water lyre.\\n\\nThe lighthouse hums with each note, and all of Styxia is swept into song. The melodies, sometimes gentle, sometimes fevered, stir boundless fantasies of delight in the Styxia Queen's heart. When the sailor begins to play in reverse from the final semibreve rest, the tune becomes whimsical and sprightly. Then, white longboats carry tumblers and jesters and glide through the canals. Men and women in splendid attire line the shores, their faces covered in masks decorated with gold leaf and feathers. The Queen slips among them, drifting through the scent of lilac and almonds.\\n\\nThen, the sailor sharpens the rhythm, the notes ringing wild and triumphant. A city-wide play unfolds with Styxia as the stage. Townsfolk dressed as pirates wave black flags, storming the walls that were never defended. They plunder wine and gold, hang nobles upon flower-strewn gallows, and crown every beggar in the city. At the finale, the tower is set ablaze, and the crowd dances madly to the lyre's music, drunk beyond reason.\\n\\nThe crashing tide dampens the sheet music, blurring notes that are soothing and slow. In the mist before the lighthouse, the Queen steps into a new script. Dressed in a sea-blue fishtail dress, she plays the attendant of Phagousa â€” the Queen of the sea sirens.\\n\\nIn this tale, the sirens are tasked to guard an anguish beyond mortal imagination in the ocean's deepest. Using their flesh and blood, they guide the pitch-dark calamity into the Chalice of Plenty, exchanging for Styxia's eternal joy. When the appointed time comes, the sirens will finally follow the lighthouse's light and the lyre's song, and walk along the causeway to enter Styxia. The people of the city will take their hands, and together, they shall join the never-ending celebration.\\n\\nThe Queen of Styxia wades into the water, embracing an imagined demise. On a night when the tides break free from the moon's restraints, the hollow tears of the sea sirens rise like foam deep beneath the waves. They hope. They wait. They gaze upon moonlight they've never known â€” then their flesh dissolves. A pity that there is no moonlight tonight. Only the lighthouse flickers, as always â€” The tears ascend instead of the sea sirens, surfacing onto the glimmering sea surface, like floating foam that dissolves into the waves.\\n\\nThe lonely sailor is granted his wish. The revelers, eyes glistening with blissful tears, welcome him into Styxia. By the time the first note of the song rings out, the withered wings of death have already covered this city of everlasting joy."

Amid the raging storm, the ship was like a drifting water lily, and even the deck crafted from the sacred tree trembled violently against the towering waves.\\n\\n\"Even the once-tranquil seas, where the waves were calm and the winds gentle all year round, have now been tainted by the siren's wild and violent nature.\" The young captain stood atop the forecastle tower, his brows tightly furrowed as he gazed at the dense, dark storm clouds ahead... yet the astrolabe on his wrist remained unresponsive.\\n\\nA bolt of lightning struck down, snapping the main sail's rigging with a resounding crack. The crew fell into chaos, shouting and scrambling. The young captain bellowed, restoring order. He commanded the rowers to pull in unison, their strength guided by precise orders. The helmsman responded swiftly, steering the ship away from the towering waves that loomed like mountains. They fought against Phagousa's fury, enduring until Aquila's guiding starlight would pierce the storm. Suddenly, the captain raised his arm high, his voice cutting through the storm. The nautical compass on his wrist shimmered with scattered fragments of starlightâ€”\\n\\n\"Follow that light, everyone! We're about to break out of the storm!\"\\n\\nThe sailors rallied their spirits, singing a sea shanty in unison. The ship, like a sharpened blade, cleaved through the waves, charging toward the dawn.\\n\\n\"Soon, we will set her free from shackles. Look ahead, prepare! Set sail!\""

        "A bronze ballista bolt, as tall as a man, tore through the sea mist wrapped in flames, only to shatter into dust the moment it neared the siren's scaled armor. The pale blue tentacles coiled tightly around sailors' waists, and even when severed, they writhed across the deck, gnawing at the terrified crew.\\n\\n\"The crewmate's limbs thrashed in the air, crying out my name. That was the most terrifying sight of my seafaring career.\" The captain's voice trembled between his lips and teeth. He was not lying.\\n\\nThe colossal sea siren surfaced, its gnarled tentacles coiling tightly around the ship. Its back loomed like a drifting island. The first mate drove a searing iron spear into its gaping maw, lined with a thousand razor-sharp teeth. A spray of foul black blood splattered across the deck, darkening the planks. The crew narrowly escaped a fatal attack, but as the captain turned back, he saw the stern tower crushed beneath a massive tentacle, shattered as easily as Nikador's Lance of Fury cracking open a walnut shell. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Charge forward or retreat? All eyes turned to the captainâ€”\\n\\n\"Hard to port! Rowers, full speed! Unfurl all sails, prepare the ram for impact!\"\\n\\nThe captain's cloak billowed in the roaring wind, and the crew steeled themselves, ready to face death. Steel clashed against scales, the keel shattered, and the sea siren let out a wailing cry. Its once-mighty form, now drained of its former power, slowly sank into the depths of the sea."

        "\"Hehe, children, the Membrance Maze's harvest season is upon us once again. So... what must we prepare?\" The chief stroked his white beard with a jolly smile.\\n\"The Brew Festival!\" The fairies cheered in unison.\\n\\nAt the beginning, the Membrance Maze was but a barren land. A small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae brought seeds from the outside world and taught the fairies to plant them. When the seeds bloomed into flowers, the fairies followed their lead, collecting nectar along the grape trellises, where golden fuzzy-legged bees buzzed about. Then came the fruits, ripe and plump â€” the season of harvest. The fairies would gather to sing celebratory songs and hold feasts lasting deep into the night. And after the night? They'd bottle up that year's nectar, bury it deep in the earth, and wait for it to ferment into a potion that'd heal both winter's cold and the aches of growing up.\\n\\nThat's how every Brew Festival goes.\\nBut this year, the chief asked as he tugged his white beard, \"Has anyone seen Relimem?\"\\n\\nThe fairies searched high and low â€” until they found Relimem fast asleep at the treehouse door. A bubble puffed from the corner of its mouth, clearly immersed in an exceptionally wonderful dream. The curious Milimem crept closer and heard it murmuring in its sleep â€” \"Snowy, Reney... you promised to return. Together, we'll drink the Quillorb Fruit Brew we buried last year!\"\\n\\nIn the dream, Relimem had turned into a giant â€” so humongous, it completely blocked the tree hole to Membrance Maze. The two tiny children couldn't find a way in. Snowy and Reney tried tickling Relimem's ears with bulrush, bouncing on its belly, calling its name over and over. But Relimem slept on, far too deeply to hear them.\\n\"Oh no... what if Snowy and Reney never came back because I blocked the way?\"\\nRelimem's heart began to pound in its dream.\\n\\n\"A... Achoo!\"\\nWith a loud sneeze, Relimem woke up. Phew! Good thing it hadn't turned into a giant treehole-blocking Relimem after all. But... there were fairies gathered all around.\\n\"Snowy and Reney... did they come?\"\\nThe fairies shook their heads. No one could remember how many Brew Festivals it had been since the last time they showed up.\\nRelimem drooped again. Maybe it should've stayed in that dream just a little longer.\\nLittle Relimem didn't quite know how to describe this emotion. But if it had to try â€” it felt just like the last day of summer, when you let those flickering fireflies in the glass jar flutter away."

        "\"Don't forget our promise! Whenever you blow your Wishing Whistle, no matter how far away you are, we'll hear you.\"\\n\\nThat was the first time the small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae had stumbled into the Membrance Maze and met the fairies. They'd been playing hide-and-seek in the yard with their friends when they accidentally fell into a tree hole hidden in the tall weeds. It was deep â€” so, so deep â€” like a bottomless slide. But instead of crashing in a daze at the bottom, they tumbled right into a crowd of fairies...\\n\"One two three four five six seven! So many puppies â€” wait, no, rabbits?\"\\n\"No no no! We're do re mi fa sol la ti! I'm Dolimem, that's Solimem, and that one's Relimem!\"\\n\\nTheir friendship with the fairies was like a thousand shooting stars â€” sudden, sparkling, and unforgettable. They spent a day full of laughter together. But soon, it was time to go. If they didn't head back, Mom and Dad would start to worry.\\n\"Will we get to see each other again?\" the boy asked, a little sad.\\nFarewell... See you again... The fairies didn't quite understand those words. In the Membrance Maze, no one ever left, so there was no need to say goodbye. But judging from the look on the children's faces, they realized it must be something upsetting. The purple Relimem thought for a moment. \"Wait, Snowy, Reney! I have something for you!\"\\n\\nThe boy and girl held Relimem's gift in their palms. It was a tiny whistle shaped like a fairy's ear, handmade by Relimem itself. It had seven holes, and when blown, each note rang clear and sweet â€” Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti. Relimem said earnestly, \"If you ever want to come back and play in the Membrance Maze again, just blow this whistle. No matter if we're sleeping, singing, or building leaf houses... we'll hear you. And we'll open the tree hole to the maze for you.\"\\n\\n\"A mystery flute that wakes up fairies!\" the girl giggled. \"Pinky promise â€” we'll come back again.\"\\nFrom then on, Relimem's happiest moments were when the whistle sounded. It would always shout with joy â€” \"I hear it! I hear it with both ears!\"\\n\\nAs time passed, Snowy and Reney, who had left Aedes Elysiae behind, remembered everything about their childhood: The rusted tin toys, the armless toy soldiers in the barn, the crocheted felt flowers, the rains that never came, the dried-up blood, the wheat fields burned down to brittle husks...\\nBut they forgot the little whistle buried in the dirt... And a promise they could no longer keep."

Their compass stilled, its trembling needle pointing toward Styxia, the city of everlasting joy along the coast â€” their fated tomb of bliss. They took no heed. Unaware of death, they raised their sails in drunken glee and stepped eagerly into Phagousa's ballroom.\\n\\nFollowing the rhythm of tides and the moon, the sailors sang as they harpooned the spines of whales, as they rammed their prows into ancient glaciers, as they sailed, ever laughing... until they were lost in the mist, until the lighthouse loomed close â€” until at last, they crashed upon the reef.\\n\\nThe wrecked ships sank beneath the waves. From the sea wave, the undying rose again. The sailor climbed ashore, seaweed and salt crusting his body. The revelers of the lighthouse had waited long. They bowed, inviting him to join the eternal celebration. Following the music, they crossed the long causeway and stepped onto the white lighthouse between the reefs. Fueled by whale oil, the flame of Styxia's beacon danced cold and blue, encased in lenses carved from crystals. The tower itself stood as a massive water lyre. With every step upward, guests could see seawater siphoning through glass pipes embedded in the masonry, pulsing with the rhythm of the sea. On the terrace, the revelers danced hand in hand, circling the light as music filled the air. Their shadows stretched long across the distant sea. And there â€” at the edge of the horizon â€” the sailor saw it: the city of eternal joy he had dreamed of.\\n\\nThat was an age before decay, when pain, sorrow, and death were still unborn. Styxia basked in Phagousa's favor, embraced by a crescent bay like a cradle, lulled by lullabies tender as sleep.\\n\\nThe sailor's lips trembled with anxiety. Before him, the revelers opened their arms â€” welcoming him as kin, to share in boundless ecstasy. Yet, behind him stretched the endless gray sea. Wreckage littered the reefs, drowned souls drifting in the waves, sea anemones and coral creeping across their skin. He remembered the moment he fell â€” how the undercurrents dragged him into the dark and hopeless deep. The sea siren's cold hand had caressed his cheek. Through her blurred, gentle singing, he awoke and was pushed back toward the shimmering surface.\\n\\nYet that one moment of hesitation â€” just one glance back â€” was enough. The gates to bliss shut. Smiling, the revelers turned the sailor away from entering Styxia â€” for a soul still shaking off the remnants of trance could never withstand true rapture."

        "Like those who came before him, the lonely sailor lingers between sea and city, poised on the threshold between the mortal world and revelry. He wipes the oil seeping from the wound of a stranded whale. At nightfall, he lights the beacon. Then, seated before the light, he begins to play melodies yet unplayed on the water lyre.\\n\\nThe lighthouse hums with each note, and all of Styxia is swept into song. The melodies, sometimes gentle, sometimes fevered, stir boundless fantasies of delight in the Styxia Queen's heart. When the sailor begins to play in reverse from the final semibreve rest, the tune becomes whimsical and sprightly. Then, white longboats carry tumblers and jesters and glide through the canals. Men and women in splendid attire line the shores, their faces covered in masks decorated with gold leaf and feathers. The Queen slips among them, drifting through the scent of lilac and almonds.\\n\\nThen, the sailor sharpens the rhythm, the notes ringing wild and triumphant. A city-wide play unfolds with Styxia as the stage. Townsfolk dressed as pirates wave black flags, storming the walls that were never defended. They plunder wine and gold, hang nobles upon flower-strewn gallows, and crown every beggar in the city. At the finale, the tower is set ablaze, and the crowd dances madly to the lyre's music, drunk beyond reason.\\n\\nThe crashing tide dampens the sheet music, blurring notes that are soothing and slow. In the mist before the lighthouse, the Queen steps into a new script. Dressed in a sea-blue fishtail dress, she plays the attendant of Phagousa â€” the Queen of the sea sirens.\\n\\nIn this tale, the sirens are tasked to guard an anguish beyond mortal imagination in the ocean's deepest. Using their flesh and blood, they guide the pitch-dark calamity into the Chalice of Plenty, exchanging for Styxia's eternal joy. When the appointed time comes, the sirens will finally follow the lighthouse's light and the lyre's song, and walk along the causeway to enter Styxia. The people of the city will take their hands, and together, they shall join the never-ending celebration.\\n\\nThe Queen of Styxia wades into the water, embracing an imagined demise. On a night when the tides break free from the moon's restraints, the hollow tears of the sea sirens rise like foam deep beneath the waves. They hope. They wait. They gaze upon moonlight they've never known â€” then their flesh dissolves. A pity that there is no moonlight tonight. Only the lighthouse flickers, as always â€” The tears ascend instead of the sea sirens, surfacing onto the glimmering sea surface, like floating foam that dissolves into the waves.\\n\\nThe lonely sailor is granted his wish. The revelers, eyes glistening with blissful tears, welcome him into Styxia. By the time the first note of the song rings out, the withered wings of death have already covered this city of everlasting joy."

The crew narrowly escaped a fatal attack, but as the captain turned back, he saw the stern tower crushed beneath a massive tentacle, shattered as easily as Nikador's Lance of Fury cracking open a walnut shell. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Charge forward or retreat? All eyes turned to the captainâ€”\\n\\n\"Hard to port! Rowers, full speed!

So... what must we prepare?\" The chief stroked his white beard with a jolly smile.\\n\"The Brew Festival!\" The fairies cheered in unison.\\n\\nAt the beginning, the Membrance Maze was but a barren land. A small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae brought seeds from the outside world and taught the fairies to plant them. When the seeds bloomed into flowers, the fairies followed their lead, collecting nectar along the grape trellises, where golden fuzzy-legged bees buzzed about. Then came the fruits, ripe and plump â€” the season of harvest. The fairies would gather to sing celebratory songs and hold feasts lasting deep into the night. And after the night? They'd bottle up that year's nectar, bury it deep in the earth, and wait for it to ferment into a potion that'd heal both winter's cold and the aches of growing up.\\n\\nThat's how every Brew Festival goes.\\nBut this year, the chief asked as he tugged his white beard, \"Has anyone seen Relimem?\"\\n\\nThe fairies searched high and low â€” until they found Relimem fast asleep at the treehouse door. A bubble puffed from the corner of its mouth, clearly immersed in an exceptionally wonderful dream. The curious Milimem crept closer and heard it murmuring in its sleep â€” \"Snowy, Reney... you promised to return. Together, we'll drink the Quillorb Fruit Brew we buried last year!\"\\n\\nIn the dream, Relimem had turned into a giant â€” so humongous, it completely blocked the tree hole to Membrance Maze. The two tiny children couldn't find a way in. Snowy and Reney tried tickling Relimem's ears with bulrush, bouncing on its belly, calling its name over and over. But Relimem slept on, far too deeply to hear them.\\n\"Oh no... what if Snowy and Reney never came back because I blocked the way?\"\\nRelimem's heart began to pound in its dream.\\n\\n\"A... Achoo!\"\\nWith a loud sneeze, Relimem woke up. Phew! Good thing it hadn't turned into a giant treehole-blocking Relimem after all. But... there were fairies gathered all around.\\n\"Snowy and Reney... did they come?\"\\nThe fairies shook their heads. No one could remember how many Brew Festivals it had been since the last time they showed up.\\nRelimem drooped again. Maybe it should've stayed in that dream just a little longer.\\nLittle Relimem didn't quite know how to describe this emotion. But if it had to try â€” it felt just like the last day of summer, when you let those flickering fireflies in the glass jar flutter away."

Whenever you blow your Wishing Whistle, no matter how far away you are, we'll hear you.\"\\n\\nThat was the first time the small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae had stumbled into the Membrance Maze and met the fairies. They'd been playing hide-and-seek in the yard with their friends when they accidentally fell into a tree hole hidden in the tall weeds. It was deep â€” so, so deep â€” like a bottomless slide. But instead of crashing in a daze at the bottom, they tumbled right into a crowd of fairies...\\n\"One two three four five six seven! So many puppies â€” wait, no, rabbits?\"\\n\"No no no! We're do re mi fa sol la ti! I'm Dolimem, that's Solimem, and that one's Relimem!\"\\n\\nTheir friendship with the fairies was like a thousand shooting stars â€” sudden, sparkling, and unforgettable. They spent a day full of laughter together. But soon, it was time to go. If they didn't head back, Mom and Dad would start to worry.\\n\"Will we get to see each other again?\" the boy asked, a little sad.\\nFarewell... See you again... The fairies didn't quite understand those words. In the Membrance Maze, no one ever left, so there was no need to say goodbye. But judging from the look on the children's faces, they realized it must be something upsetting. The purple Relimem thought for a moment. \"Wait, Snowy, Reney! I have something for you!\"\\n\\nThe boy and girl held Relimem's gift in their palms. It was a tiny whistle shaped like a fairy's ear, handmade by Relimem itself. It had seven holes, and when blown, each note rang clear and sweet â€” Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti. Relimem said earnestly, \"If you ever want to come back and play in the Membrance Maze again, just blow this whistle. No matter if we're sleeping, singing, or building leaf houses... we'll hear you. And we'll open the tree hole to the maze for you.\"\\n\\n\"A mystery flute that wakes up fairies!\" the girl giggled. \"Pinky promise â€” we'll come back again.\"\\nFrom then on, Relimem's happiest moments were when the whistle sounded. It would always shout with joy â€” \"I hear it! I hear it with both ears!\"\\n\\nAs time passed, Snowy and Reney, who had left Aedes Elysiae behind, remembered everything about their childhood: The rusted tin toys, the armless toy soldiers in the barn, the crocheted felt flowers, the rains that never came, the dried-up blood, the wheat fields burned down to brittle husks...\\nBut they forgot the little whistle buried in the dirt... And a promise they could no longer keep."

Their compass stilled, its trembling needle pointing toward Styxia, the city of everlasting joy along the coast â€” their fated tomb of bliss. They took no heed. Unaware of death, they raised their sails in drunken glee and stepped eagerly into Phagousa's ballroom.\\n\\nFollowing the rhythm of tides and the moon, the sailors sang as they harpooned the spines of whales, as they rammed their prows into ancient glaciers, as they sailed, ever laughing... until they were lost in the mist, until the lighthouse loomed close â€” until at last, they crashed upon the reef.\\n\\nThe wrecked ships sank beneath the waves. From the sea wave, the undying rose again. The sailor climbed ashore, seaweed and salt crusting his body. The revelers of the lighthouse had waited long. They bowed, inviting him to join the eternal celebration. Following the music, they crossed the long causeway and stepped onto the white lighthouse between the reefs. Fueled by whale oil, the flame of Styxia's beacon danced cold and blue, encased in lenses carved from crystals. The tower itself stood as a massive water lyre. With every step upward, guests could see seawater siphoning through glass pipes embedded in the masonry, pulsing with the rhythm of the sea. On the terrace, the revelers danced hand in hand, circling the light as music filled the air. Their shadows stretched long across the distant sea. And there â€” at the edge of the horizon â€” the sailor saw it: the city of eternal joy he had dreamed of.\\n\\nThat was an age before decay, when pain, sorrow, and death were still unborn. Styxia basked in Phagousa's favor, embraced by a crescent bay like a cradle, lulled by lullabies tender as sleep.\\n\\nThe sailor's lips trembled with anxiety. Before him, the revelers opened their arms â€” welcoming him as kin, to share in boundless ecstasy. Yet, behind him stretched the endless gray sea. Wreckage littered the reefs, drowned souls drifting in the waves, sea anemones and coral creeping across their skin. He remembered the moment he fell â€” how the undercurrents dragged him into the dark and hopeless deep. The sea siren's cold hand had caressed his cheek. Through her blurred, gentle singing, he awoke and was pushed back toward the shimmering surface.\\n\\nYet that one moment of hesitation â€” just one glance back â€” was enough. The gates to bliss shut. Smiling, the revelers turned the sailor away from entering Styxia â€” for a soul still shaking off the remnants of trance could never withstand true rapture."

        "Like those who came before him, the lonely sailor lingers between sea and city, poised on the threshold between the mortal world and revelry. He wipes the oil seeping from the wound of a stranded whale. At nightfall, he lights the beacon. Then, seated before the light, he begins to play melodies yet unplayed on the water lyre.\\n\\nThe lighthouse hums with each note, and all of Styxia is swept into song. The melodies, sometimes gentle, sometimes fevered, stir boundless fantasies of delight in the Styxia Queen's heart. When the sailor begins to play in reverse from the final semibreve rest, the tune becomes whimsical and sprightly. Then, white longboats carry tumblers and jesters and glide through the canals. Men and women in splendid attire line the shores, their faces covered in masks decorated with gold leaf and feathers. The Queen slips among them, drifting through the scent of lilac and almonds.\\n\\nThen, the sailor sharpens the rhythm, the notes ringing wild and triumphant. A city-wide play unfolds with Styxia as the stage. Townsfolk dressed as pirates wave black flags, storming the walls that were never defended. They plunder wine and gold, hang nobles upon flower-strewn gallows, and crown every beggar in the city. At the finale, the tower is set ablaze, and the crowd dances madly to the lyre's music, drunk beyond reason.\\n\\nThe crashing tide dampens the sheet music, blurring notes that are soothing and slow. In the mist before the lighthouse, the Queen steps into a new script. Dressed in a sea-blue fishtail dress, she plays the attendant of Phagousa â€” the Queen of the sea sirens.\\n\\nIn this tale, the sirens are tasked to guard an anguish beyond mortal imagination in the ocean's deepest. Using their flesh and blood, they guide the pitch-dark calamity into the Chalice of Plenty, exchanging for Styxia's eternal joy. When the appointed time comes, the sirens will finally follow the lighthouse's light and the lyre's song, and walk along the causeway to enter Styxia. The people of the city will take their hands, and together, they shall join the never-ending celebration.\\n\\nThe Queen of Styxia wades into the water, embracing an imagined demise. On a night when the tides break free from the moon's restraints, the hollow tears of the sea sirens rise like foam deep beneath the waves. They hope. They wait. They gaze upon moonlight they've never known â€” then their flesh dissolves. A pity that there is no moonlight tonight. Only the lighthouse flickers, as always â€” The tears ascend instead of the sea sirens, surfacing onto the glimmering sea surface, like floating foam that dissolves into the waves.\\n\\nThe lonely sailor is granted his wish. The revelers, eyes glistening with blissful tears, welcome him into Styxia. By the time the first note of the song rings out, the withered wings of death have already covered this city of everlasting joy."
